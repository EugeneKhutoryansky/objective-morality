## Title page

**Original URL:** https://veg1.org/Animal_Rights.html

**Animal Rights and Vegan Ethics**  
**Written by Eugene Khutoryansky**

The purpose of this web page is to answer the most commonly
asked questions about animal rights.

Before I begin, I believe that it is important to put the topic
of animal rights into historical perceptive. One hundred years ago,
racial segregation was considered acceptable in the United
States. Two hundred years ago, slavery was considered morally
acceptable by the vast majority of the world. Two thousand years
ago, it was considered acceptable to feed innocent
people to lions for public entertainment. 

In each case, morality progressed because a small number of
people looked at the ethics of their society, and concluded that
it needed to be improved. Now is no better a time to think that
we have it all figured out than were any of these other points in
history. Simply put, truth is not democratic.  The Earth
does not become flat just because the majority of the population
thinks that it is.  Nor does an activity become morally
justified just because it has been going on for a long
time.  Slavery, genocide, rape, and torture are all
activities which have been going on since long before the dawn of
recorded human history.

In this web page, I am going to present logical arguments for
claims which, at present, most people do not agree with. 
For example, I am going to be arguing that it is immoral to kill animals for food or
clothing.  Many people today view such claims as
extreme.  However, if a person several thousand years ago
had argued for the abolition of slavery, or the abolition of
gladiatorial combat, they would have received the same reaction.

## What about how other animals kill and eat each other?

**What about how other animals kill and eat
each other?**  




There is a big distinction between the situation when a lion eats meat, and the situation when a human eats meat. Lions can not decide to live on grain and vegetables. A lion must eat meat or die. A vegan diet for humans, on the other hand, is actually healthier than one which includes meat. Whereas lions must eat meat to survive, humans eat meat simply for the pleasure of tasting meat.

There is another significant difference between lions and
humans.  Lions do not raise their prey on factory farms, where animals are forced to
endure a lifetime of suffering and confinement.

## Human beings are a part of the food chain, and eating meat is natural. So then, how can it be wrong?

**Original URL:** https://veg1.org/meat_is_natural.html


**Human beings are a part of the food chain,
and eating meat is natural. So then, how can eating meat be
wrong?**  

  

  

Eating meat is indeed natural in the sense that other animals do
it as well. In fact, it is even done on occasion by our closest
living relatives, the chimpanzees. However, there are many other
things which are also natural. For example, chimpanzee males
sometimes rape the females in their tribe. Chimpanzees sometimes
engage in organized warfare against other tribes with which they
compete for territory. A chimpanzee male, in a moment of rage,
sometimes picks up a nearby infant, and crushes his skull against
a rock. And chimpanzees do on occasion eat meat, and they do on
occasion engage in cannibalism, in spite of the fact that there
is a plentiful supply of food from other sources.

So eating meat is indeed absolutely natural. However, the fact
that it is natural does not imply that it is ethically
permissible. If we believed that eating meat was ethically
permissible simply because other animals did it as well, then
this would imply that there is nothing wrong with rape, cannibalism, or infanticide, all of
which routinely occurs throughout the animal kingdom.

The truth of the matter is that other animals share the
darkest aspects of our humanity, as well as those aspects of which we are the most proud.

<a id="survival_of_the_fittest"></a>

## What do you think about the phrase "survival of the fittest"?

**Original URL:** https://veg1.org/survival_of_the_fittest.html


**What do you think about the phrase "survival
of the fittest"?**  

  

  

The phrase "survival of the fittest" describes the
process of natural selection which has been occurring on our
planet for the past several million years, but it is not a
prescription for our ethical guidelines. Consider our ethics with
regards to other human beings. We care for the weak and the sick,
as well as for the strong and the healthy. We take care of the
elderly and the infirm, and do not simply leave them to die
outside in the cold.

Also, we should keep in mind that "survival of the
fittest" has nothing to do with the way in which we
currently kill animals for food. This is because all farm animals
are eventually sent to the slaughter house, regardless of how fit
they are. In fact, humans have altered farm animals through
selective breeding to enhance characteristics humans find
desirable, even though these characteristics significantly reduce
the "fitness" of the animals. For example, turkeys have
been selectively bred to produce large breasts, which consumers
prefer. However, the breasts have now become so large that the
turkeys are no longer able to mount each other and reproduce
naturally. As a result, all commercially bred turkeys in the U.S.
can reproduce only through artificial insemination.

Survival of the fittest also has little to do with the way in
which humans currently kill animals through hunting. Whereas
predators like wolves are more likely to kill young and weak
animals, a hunter's riffle does not necessarily make such a
distinction. On the contrary, a human hunter may actually prefer
to kill a strong and healthy animal because he makes a better
trophy.

<a id="prevent_predation"></a>

## Should we try to prevent other animals from killing and eating each other?

**Original URL:** https://veg1.org/prevent_predation.html


**Should we try to prevent other animals from
killing and eating each other?**

If we attempted to do this, it would result in an ecological
disaster. It is necessary for animals such as lions to hunt in
order for an ecological balance to be maintained. If all lions
stopped hunting, it would be extremely detrimental to many of the
species in the area, including the prey species itself. The harm
done from the resulting ecological catastrophe would far outweigh
any good which may have been done by saving a few gazelle from
being eaten by lions.

By contrast, farm animals exist in such large numbers only because humans breed them for slaughter, in numbers proportional to consumer demand, and animal agriculture is one of the leading causes of wildlife habitat destruction. Whereas lions and tigers help the environment and ecology by eating meat, we humans greatly harm the environment and ecology every time we purchase meat.

<a id="cannibalism"></a>

## How common is cannibalism in the animal kingdom?

**Original URL:** https://veg1.org/cannibalism.html


**How common is cannibalism in the animal kingdom?**

Cannibalism is quite common among animals. Lions eat other
lions, bears eat other bears, and chimpanzees eat other
chimpanzees. This is not necessarily the result of a food
shortage. Such incidents occur even when there is a plentiful
supply of food from other sources. In the case of lions, for
example, a male lion sometimes kills and eats the cubs of a
female lion without a partner to protect her. The male lion does
this because the female lion will not mate as long as she has
cubs, but she will mate after the cubs are dead. For some
species, cannibalism is extremely common. Approximately one fifth
of the diet of a tiger salamander, for example, consists of other
tiger salamanders.

The point to be learned from this is that we should not be
basing our moral code on the behavior of other animals, but
instead strive for something better. If we were to believe that
eating meat is OK simply because other animals did it as well,
then this would imply that there is also nothing wrong with
cannibalism.

<a id="deer_overpopulation"></a>

## Isn't hunting by humans necessary to prevent deer overpopulation?

**Original URL:** https://veg1.org/deer_overpopulation.html


**Isn't hunting by humans necessary to prevent deer
overpopulation?**

In many cases, when people claim there is deer overpopulation,
what is really going on is that some residents are upset that
deer are eating the flowers on their front lawn, when in reality
there is no overpopulation problem - with the possible exception
of human overpopulation.

Nevertheless, there are some cases where there genuinely is a
severe deer overpopulation problem. Some communities have
successfully dealt with this situation through deer sterilization
programs. The primary problem with this approach is that it costs
between $200 and $300 per deer, and most communities are
unwilling to pay this cost.

However, we should realize that the most overpopulated species
on the planet is us humans, and no other species adversely
affects the environment as much as we do. However, we generally
do not consider it to be an ethically acceptable solution to kill
the excess human population. We try to address our own
overpopulation problem by reducing our birth rate, not by
increasing our death rate. Similarly, I believe that this is also
the ethically preferable solution for dealing with deer
overpopulation.

<a id="eating_their_food"></a>

## If you care about animals, then why are you eating all their food?

**Original URL:** https://veg1.org/eating_their_food.html


**If you care about animals, then why are you eating all their food?**  

  

  

As more people go vegan, this will mean that there will be more food available for animals to eat, and not less. This is due to the fact that animal agriculture is one of the leading causes of wildlife habitat destruction. Farm animals exist in such large numbers only because humans breed them for slaughter, in numbers proportional to consumer demand, and only a small fraction of the food that an animal eats is converted into food for human consumption. Therefore, growing crops to feed livestock inherently requires far more land and resources than does growing crops consumed directly by humans, to feed the same number of people. Much native wildlife habitat is destroyed to grow crops fed to livestock, and the amount by which this happens depends on the number of people eating meat and other animal products.

  

  

Animal agriculture also destroys native wildlife habitat as the result of the runoff from the concentrated animal waste from the farms, and as the result of the greenhouse gas emissions leading to global warming. Animal agriculture emits more green house gasses than do all the cars and trucks on the planet combined. As more people go vegan, more wildlife habitat is saved, and more food is therefore available for the animals.

<a id="dominion"></a>

## Doesn't the Bible say that humans have dominion over the animals?

**Original URL:** https://veg1.org/dominion.html


**Doesn't the Bible say that humans have
dominion over the animals?**  

  

  

Yes, the Bible states this in the story of Genesis after God
creates Adam and Eve and the Garden of Eden. Although I myself
believe in the theory of evolution, there are some vegans
and animal rights activists who do believe in the literal
interpretation of the Bible. These individuals would point out
that according to the literal interpretation of Genesis, no
animal ever died in the Garden of Eden prior to the original sin. Therefore, in the Garden
of Eden, Adam and Eve and all the animals were vegetarians.

In this context, the phrase "dominion over the
animals" could not have referred to killing and eating them.
Many would argue that "dominion" is more accurately
interpreted as "stewardship" rather than tyranny.
Furthermore, since the Garden of Eden represents the highest
ethical ideal, some people who believe in the literal
interpretation of the Bible interpret this to mean that
veganism is the highest ethical ideal.

In any case, the torture of animals is considered an abomination in every major religion. 
Yet this is precisely what virtually every person in our society is doing, given how modern animal agriculture industry presently operates. 
If we pay people in the industry to do this on our behalf, then we are just as responsible as they are. 
Today, even the farms labeled "Free Range" and "Organic" are typically not much better than standard factory farms.
One can not sincerely claim to follow the Bible, the Torah, or the Quran, and then continue on with business as usual on this matter.

<a id="leviticus"></a>

## Doesn't the Bible specifically state that it is ok to kill animals for food?

**Original URL:** https://veg1.org/leviticus.html


**Doesn't the Bible specifically state that it is ok
to kill animals for food?**  

  

  

Yes, it does. In particular, Exodus and Leviticus of the Old Testament give
very specific rules for how animals are to be slaughtered and
which animals can be eaten. Exodus and Leviticus are also the sections of the
Old Testament which specifically state that slavery is
permitted, and which give very specific rules for how slaves are
to be treated. During the movement to abolish human slavery, many
abolitionists were accused of going against the will of God, due
to the fact that slavery is specifically condoned by the Bible. Nevertheless, the movement to abolish human slavery included
many Bible believing Christians, as does the modern animal rights
movement.

The word "slave" in the Bible meant the same thing that it does today, as can be seen from the following passages.

People who believe in the literal interpretation of the
Bible are often troubled by these types of passages in the Old
and New Testaments. The following is one possible explanation
which some of them can offer. A society can absorb only a limited amount of change at one
time. It could be argued that God knew that if he commanded
humans to abolish slavery and abolish the practice of killing
animals for food, then this would simply be too great a shock for
society to accept all at once, and most people would just end up
ignoring the commandments altogether. Therefore, by giving
specific rules for how slaves are to be treated, and for how
animals are to be slaughtered, it could be argued that God made
these practices considerably less barbaric than they would have
been otherwise - although his real intention was for people to
one day eventually realize that the message of compassion should
be applied to all beings, including slaves and animals.

<a id="animal_soul"></a>

## Don't only human beings have a soul?

**Original URL:** https://veg1.org/animal_soul.html


**Don't only human beings have a soul?**  

  

  

There are some people who believe in the 
view that only human beings are made "in the image of
God" and that only humans have souls. Although I personally
do not agree with this view, this view is held by some
vegans and animal rights activists. Vegans with this
view would point out that regardless of whether or not animals
possess a soul, animals still feel pain and suffering just as we
do, and animals still value their lives just as we value ours.
Therefore, many of the people who believe that only humans have
souls still agree with the principle that it is wrong to inflict
death and suffering on animals simply for the pleasure of tasting
meat.

Although it is possible to believe in animal rights while
still adhering to the view that only humans have souls, I
would like to point out what the major world religions actually say on this topic.

According to the Bible, the Torah, and the Quran, a soul is required to be able to make moral decisions,
and a soul is required to be able to know the difference between good and evil.

And according to modern science, we now know that other animals do know right from wrong.
In fact, they sometimes know it much better than we humans do.

## Doesn't the Bible state that a weak person eats only vegetables, and not to pass judgement on those who eat meat?

**Original URL:** https://veg1.org/roman_shops.html


**Doesn't the Bible state that a weak person eats only vegetables, and not to pass judgement on those who eat meat?**  

  

  

The Bible passage in Romans 14:1-23 is regarding a dispute about whether Jews were obligated to avoid all meat purchased in Roman stores, due to a concern that the meat was made "unclean" by being in the presence of Roman idols. This passage was stating that only a person who is "weak in faith" would be afraid that the food can be spiritually contaminated by being in the presence of Roman idols, and that Jews who want to avoid food from Roman shops for this reason should not pass judgement on those Jews who do not avoid food from Roman shops. This was a major issue for Jews living in Rome at the time, because the only meat they had access to was from Roman shops, and many chose to avoid all meat altogether for this reason.

## What about the passage where God tells Peter to "Kill and eat"?

**Original URL:** https://veg1.org/book_of_acts.html


**What about the passage where God tells Peter to Kill and eat?**  

  

  

Most Christian scholars interpret the "Kill and Eat" passage in the Book of Acts as a message 
from God telling Peter that the message of Christ was not just for the Jews, who followed the 
Kosher dietary laws, but that the message of Christ was for all of humanity. That is, most Christian 
scholars do not interpret this phrase literally.

Even if we do not believe in animal rights, it is still difficult to explain the animal sacrifices in the Bible, as it is unclear why an infinitely powerful God would benefit from the activity.
There are many passages in the Bible that are difficult to explain, both with regards to the treatment of humans and animals. For example, consider the passage below.
  

  

1 Samuel 15:3   

"Now go, attack the Amalekites and totally destroy all that belongs to them. Do not spare them; put to death men and women, children and infants, cattle and sheep, camels and donkeys."
  

  

I am just pointing out that there are issues theologians have had to struggle with for centuries, and they often admit that they don't have any good answers.
Nevertheless, the existence of these passages in the Bible is not viewed as an excuse for us today to kill other humans needlessly. Similarly, these passages should also not be viewed as an excuse to engage in cruelty towards animals or to kill animals needlessly.

Animals were not created for humans any more than women were
created for men, or any more than black people were created for
white people. It is difficult to understand why a compassionate
God would create beings capable of feeling pain, suffering, and a
desire to live, if their only purpose in life was to suffer and
die at the hands of humans.

## What about killing plants?

**Original URL:** https://veg1.org/killing_plants.html


**What about killing plants?**  

  

  

It is not wrong to eat plants for the same reason that it is not
wrong to kill bacteria. Every time I brush my teeth, I kill
thousands of bacteria, yet I see nothing wrong with doing
so.

The distinguishing characteristic between animals and bacteria
is that animals are conscious beings capable of feeling pain and
suffering.  Animals are capable of feeling happiness, joy,
and sorrow.  Animals are capable of feeling a desire to
live.

Bacteria, on the other hand, just like plants, and just like
rocks, do not possess anything similar to a nervous system, nor
do they exhibit any behavior which would indicate that they
possess consciousness. Bacteria are not capable of feeling pain
or suffering. Bacteria are not capable of feeling a desire to
live. Bacteria, just like plants, and just like rocks, are not
capable of feeling anything whatsoever.

When you kick a rock, you do not have to worry about whether
or not you are inflicting suffering on the rock, or interfering
with the rock's desire to live, since rocks are incapable of such
feelings. It is for this reason that it is not immoral to kick
rocks, and it is for this same reason that it is not immoral to
eat plants.

## How do you know that plants can not feel pain?

**Original URL:** https://veg1.org/plant_consciousness.html


**How do you know that plants can not feel pain?**

I believe that our consciousness is intimately connected to
our brain and nervous system. By the term
"consciousness", I am referring to the ability to feel
sensations such as pain, suffering, and a desire to live. Once a
person is brain dead, he is no longer able to feel such
sensations. Therefore, since plants do not possess anything even
remotely resembling a nervous system, I believe it is extremely
unlikely that plants can feel pain or suffering.

Furthermore, plants do not exhibit any behavior which would indicate consciousness, nor does the ability to feel pain give plants an evolutionary survival advantage. An animal's survival depends on reacting to situations which may cause pain and suffering. On the other hand, plants can not run away from a predator, nor can plants change their position to avoid a forest fire. Therefore, it is unlikely that plants would develop the ability to feel pain when it confers no survival advantage.

Plants have the ability to react to an outside stimulus, such as responding with a chemical defense when they are being eaten by insects. However, even a brain dead human will respond in the same way, in that the body will exhibit a chemical defense when doctors try to harvest the organs for donation. However, without a functioning brain, there is no pain or consciousness present. The same is most likely true in the case of plants.

**What would you do if we hypothetically discovered
that plants do indeed feel pain?**

As it turns out, even if a person's primary goal in life is to
minimize the number of plants which are killed, they should still
become a vegan.

This is because plants have to be fed to the livestock, and
meat production is extremely inefficient.  Only a small
fraction of the food which is eaten by animals is converted into
meat for human consumption.  Therefore, by eating meat, not
only do we cause animal death and suffering, we also end up
killing many more plants than we would if we ate a vegan
diet.

## Don't plants move their leaves to follow the sun?

**Original URL:** https://veg1.org/plants_move_leaves.html


**Don't plants move their leaves to follow the sun?**  

  

  

Yes. This indicates that plants have the ability to react to an
outside stimulus. However, a simple response to an outside
stimulus does not, in and of itself, indicate the ability to feel
pain. As an example, an electric doorbell can also respond to an
outside stimulus. It detects the pressure of a human finger, and
it responds by ringing. However, the fact that the doorbell can
react this way to the presence of your finger does not imply that
the doorbell is conscious. Similarly, the ability of plants to
move their leaves to follow the sun does not, in and of itself,
indicate consciousness.

**Aren't there some religions which believe that
plants possess a soul?**

Yes. This is particularly true of certain religions which
believe that after we die, we are reincarnated as plants or
animals. Many of these religions state that a plant's soul spends
its entire life in a state similar to what we are in when we are
in deep sleep. When we are in deep sleep, we are not aware of our
surroundings, nor are we dreaming. Therefore, many people who
believe that plants possess a soul do not have a problem
accepting that plants are incapable of feeling pain or a desire
to live.

## How do you know that other animals can feel pain?

**Original URL:** https://veg1.org/animal_consciousness.html


**How do you know that other animals can feel pain?**  

  

  

We know that other animals feel pain in the same way that we know
that other human beings feel pain. We do not need words to
understand the suffering of a famine victim whose language we do
not understand. Through their physical reactions, we try to infer
the pain of other human beings, even though we can never
ascertain it with absolute certainty.

We know how we ourselves react to situations which cause us
pain. When other animals, or other humans, are subjected to these
same conditions, they exhibit the same physical responses that we
do. Regardless of what we might think about the alleged
superiority of humans over animals in all other areas, when it
comes to the ability to feel pain and suffering, other animals
will forever be our equals.

## Where in the animal kingdom does consciousness begin?

**Original URL:** https://veg1.org/where_consciousness_begins.html


**Where in the animal kingdom does consciousness
begin?**  

  

  

No one can answer this question with any degree of certainty.
However, the animals which humans kill for food and clothing clearly are conscious.
Therefore, the fact that we do not know precisely the location of
the demarcation line should not be an excuse for us to continue
to kill animals for food.

Nevertheless, it is interesting to speculate about where in
the animal kingdom consciousness begins. It is important to point
out that by the term "consciousness", I am simply
referring to the ability to feel sensations like pain or hunger.
Consciousness is not necessarily related to intelligence.

A severely mentally retarded human is just as conscious as is
anyone else. The fact that a severely mentally retarded human
does not have the capacity to understand multivariable calculus
doe not imply that he feels pain or suffering any less than we
do. On the other hand, a programmable calculator might be
extremely good at multivariable calculus, but possess no
consciousness whatsoever.

My personal opinion, although I can not prove it, is that the
demarcation line for consciousness lies somewhere in the insect world. I believe that at least
some types of insects do possess the capacity to feel pain, and I
do include insects in my animal rights philosophy.

## Is it ok to kill animals which do not possess consciousness?

**Is it ok to kill animals which do not possess
consciousness?**  

  

  

If it turns out that a certain animal species do not possess consciousness, then from an ethical perspective I
believe that this would imply that they fall into the same
category as plants.

In some cases, we may wish to refrain from killing such
animals for environmental and ecological reasons, just as we may
wish to refrain from killing certain plants for these same
concerns.

However, I see nothing wrong in principle with killing an
animal for food if the animal possesses no more consciousness
than does a plant or a brain dead human.

## What about insects?

**Original URL:** https://veg1.org/insects.html


**What about insects?**

I include insects in my animal rights philosophy. I try to
avoid accidentally stepping on insects. Also, when I find an
insect in my home, I try to carefully carry the insect outside
without injuring him.

With regards to animal rights, the distinguishing
characteristic between plants and animals is that animals possess
consciousness, whereas plants do not. Although I can not prove it with absolute 100%
certainty, I believe that at least certain insects are also
conscious. By this, I do not mean that insects discuss
philosophy, but simply that they feel sensations such as pain and
hunger. For this reason, I believe we should include insects in
our sphere of compassion.

It is true that regardless of how hard we try, we are
inevitably going to accidentally kill some insects during our
lifetimes. It is also true that regardless of how hard we try,
some people are going to be killed in car accidents. However, the
fact that we might run over someone with our car by accident does
not imply that it is ok to run them over on purpose.

There are non-lethal methods for removing insects. Many of these
methods simply involve using common household products, such as
dish washing fluid. The smell from the chemicals in these
products does not harm the insects, but causes them to leave our
homes.

**Do you view the killing of an insect as the moral
equivalent of killing a bird or mammal?**  

  

  

Although I include insects in my animal rights philosophy, I
recognize that there are important differences between insects
and animals such as birds and mammals. One, for example, is the
fact that many insects have extremely short life spans.

The importance of this can be illustrated through the
following example. Suppose you were in a burning building, and
could only save one of two individuals. One of these individuals
is a terminally ill patient who only has several days to live,
even if he is rescued. The other individual, however, is young
and healthy. I believe that the choice in this case is fairly
simple.

Given the fact that the entire life span of some insects is
only a few days, this is the same principle I would apply if I
had to choose between saving a mammal or saving an insect.

<a id="insect_instinct"></a>

## Don't insects only behave on an instinctual level?

**Original URL:** https://veg1.org/insect_instinct.html


**Don't insects only behave on an instinctual level?**  

  

  

Many insects do behave on only an instinctual level. However,
there are also insects which exhibit learned behavior. This is
especially true of social insects such as bees. For example, bees
must learn and remember the location of food, and communicate
this to the other bees in the hive - and this example is rather
simple compared to some of the more complex tasks which bees do,
such as the democratic process through which a group of bees
selects a location for a new hive.

To find a location for a hive, many different scouts go out
searching. When they return, they communicate to the other bees
the location and desirability of the site which they found. The
scouts then go out again and investigate a location which other
bees had indicated were desirable. At this point, each scout
decides whether or not this new location is preferable to the one
which she herself found. When she returns back, she will
communicate this to the rest of the hive. This process repeats
itself, and each bee will continue to change her allegiance from
one potential site to another. Eventually, certain sites will
become much more popular among the bees than any of the others.
The greater the number of bees which prefer a particular
location, the more likely the scouts are to investigate this
location and judge for themselves. In this way, the hive
eventually reaches a consensus, and selects a location for their
new home.

Some people will, no doubt, accuse me of using
anthropomorphizing terminology in describing this process, and I
am certainly guilty of this. However, it would be much more
difficult to describe this process if I was not allowed to use
phrases referring to what the bees "believe" or
"decide".

In any case, what this story demonstrates is that there is
more to insect behavior than just instinct. Instinctual behavior
consists of repeating the same motions regardless of past
experience. However, these bees clearly do take into account what
they remember from their previous scouting missions, and they
make complex decisions.

It is interesting to note that in order for this process of
consensus to work, each bee has to be willing to objectively
decide on the desirability of a site, regardless of whether or
not this is a site which she herself found. If humans were to try
to repeat this process, humans would have difficulty exhibiting
such impartiality. Unfortunately, human nature is such that we
tend to prefer the option which we ourselves found, regardless of
whether or not it is the best one.

## Do ants recognize their reflection in a mirror?

**Original URL:** https://veg1.org/ants.html


**Do ants recognize their reflection in a mirror?**  

  

  

The following is quoted from the website   

<https://www.animalcognition.org/2015/04/15/list-of-animals-that-have-passed-the-mirror-test/>

In 2015, scientists published research that suggests some ants can recognize themselves when looking in a mirror. When viewing other ants through glass, ants didn't divert from their normal behaviors.

However, their behavior did change when they were put in front of a mirror. The ants would move slowly, turn their heads back and forth, shake their antennae, and touch the mirror. They'd retreat and re-approach the mirror. Sometimes they would groom themselves.

The ants were next given a classic mirror test. The team of researchers would use blue dots to mark the clypeus of some of the ants, which is a part of their face near their mouths.

When in an environment without mirrors, these ants would behave normally, and wouldn't touch the markings. But this changed when they could see their reflections in a mirror. The ants with blue dots on their face would groom and appear to try to remove the markings.

Very young ants, and other ants with brown dots that blended in with the color of their face didn't clean themselves. Interestingly, neither did ants with blue dots put on the back of their heads.

When put in the company of those with blue-dotted faces, other ants would respond aggressively, presumably because the difference caused them to think the blue-dotted ant was an outsider (not a member of their colony). All of this lead the researchers to conclude that the clypeus is a species-specific physical characteristic that is important for group acceptance.

Given that these ants tried to clean the mark rather than respond aggressively, the ants likely didn't think their reflection was just another ant. The team thinks their study shows that self-recognition is not an "unrealistic" ability in ants.

## Would you rather save your child or your dog?

**Original URL:** https://veg1.org/your_child_or_your_dog.html


**What if you were in a burning building and
could only save your child or your dog?**  

  

  

It is true that most people would save their child from a burning
building before they save a dog.  Most people would
also save their own child before they save the child of a
stranger.  These actions are not necessarily immoral. 
However, this does not imply that it is OK to experiment on
other people's children in order to find a cure for your own.

The important thing to remember is that in many cases, there
are alternative methods for performing medical research without testing on animals, and
that the animals used in these experiments often suffer a fate
far worse than death.  For example, a common practice for
those who use dogs in their research is to remove the dog's vocal
cords so that the researchers will not be bothered by the dog's
screaming.

However, regardless of what we think about the more
controversial aspects of animal rights, such as medical
experimentation on animals, we should keep in mind that veganism is not a case of
choosing between saving your child or your dog.

One example is in-vitro studies, where experiments are performed
on cell and tissue cultures, instead of on animals. Another
example is computer simulations which predict the toxicity of
chemicals based on their molecular structure. Other examples
include epidemiologic studies and clinical research.

Even researchers who strongly advocate the continued use of
animal testing generally agree that the number of animal tests
can be significantly reduced if alternative methods were used
more widely.

## Do animal rights supporters refrain from using life saving drugs which were developed through animal testing?

**Original URL:** https://veg1.org/refrain_from_drugs.html


**Do animal rights supporters refrain from
using life saving drugs which were developed through animal
testing?**

A few of them do. However, I personally do not believe that
this is ethically required.

To explain, let us hypothetically suppose that while the Nazis
were experimenting on prisoners during World War II, they had
discovered the cure to cancer. Hypothetically suppose that the
question before us, now that the Nazis have been defeated, is
what to do with this cure. Should we use it, or should we discard
it?

My answer to this question is an extremely controversial one,
and it is one which many other animal rights activists and
vegans strongly disagree with. My answer is use it. I
believe that it would make no sense to discard the cure for
cancer simply because it was obtained in an unethical way. We can
condemn the means through which the Nazis discovered it, and vow
to never repeat their mistakes, while at the same time use this
cure to save as many lives as possible.

This is also my attitude with regards to the use of life
saving drugs which were developed through animal testing.

## Aren't there laws regulating the use of animals in laboratories?

**Original URL:** https://veg1.org/animal_welfare_act.html


**Aren't there laws regulating the use of animals in
laboratories?**

In the United States, the Animal Welfare Act regulates the use
of laboratory animals, though it is often not enforced. Also,
there is a loophole in this law, due to the fact that the U.S.
federal government does not classify mice, rats, and birds as
animals.

As a result, the Animal Welfare Act does not apply to mice,
rats, and birds, and there are no federal restrictions on what
can be done to these animals in research labs.

It should be mentioned that the Animal Welfare Act **also
does not apply** to farmed animals which are raised for
food.

## How is experimenting on animals any different from other situations where humans kill animals for survival?

**Original URL:** https://veg1.org/experimenting_survival.html


**How is experimenting on animals any different from
other situations where humans kill animals for survival?**

Aside from the fact that there are often alternative methods for
doing medical research, the concern regarding experimentation is
not just that animals are killed in the process. The greater
concern is the suffering involved, which is often a fate
considerably worse than death. This is the reason why even people
who support the death penalty would consider it appalling to
perform such experiments on convicted felons awaiting execution.

## What if the cure to cancer could be produced by a hypothetical experiment on just a single animal?

**Original URL:** https://veg1.org/single_experiment.html


**What if the cure to cancer could be produced by a
hypothetical experiment on just a single animal?**

Under these hypothetical conditions, many animal rights
supporters would allow the experiment. Of course, these
conditions are completely unrealistic, and would never be met in
real life. Nevertheless, I believe that discussing such
hypothetical scenarios sheds considerable insight into the issues
involved.

Let us consider a new hypothetical scenario which is slightly
different. Again, suppose that the cure to cancer could be
produced by a hypothetical experiment on just a single test
subject. However, in this new scenario, **suppose
that the test subject must be a human being**.

We can try to escape the ethical dilemma by volunteering
ourselves as the test subject. However, let us hypothetically
suppose that the test subject must meet certain physical
criteria, and that neither we nor any other volunteers meet this
criteria. Therefore, if we are to perform this single experiment
and cure cancer, we must select an innocent human being against
his will.

Let us also hypothetically suppose that we have found a
potential test subject without any friends or relatives.
Furthermore, suppose that he is severely mentally retarded, and
that his potential for intelligence is no greater than that of a
typical laboratory rat. Do we believe that performing this
experiment is ethically acceptable?

Some people would say that it is never permissible to take an
innocent human life under any conditions, and would find the
entire suggestion abhorrent. Others would point out that we kill
innocent people when we bomb enemy countries in times of war, and
that we do this for reasons considerably less noble than finding
the cure to cancer.

Many others would respond that while they are not pacifists,
there are significant moral distinctions between killing people
in times of war and performing an experiment on a human being
against his will. Others would respond that we should at least
consider performing the experiment depending on how much
suffering the person will have to endure before he dies.

Regardless of how we answer, we should at least be logically
consistent in the application of our ethical principles. That is,
our answer should not change depending on if the potential test
subject is of the same race or ethnicity as we are. Nor should
our answer change based on the potential test subject's gender or
nationality.

Although this is a view which is not shared by all animal
rights supporters, I believe that our answer should also not
change depending on whether or not the potential test subject is
of the same species as us. I believe that the species boundary is
no less arbitrary than boundaries such as race, ethnicity, and
nationality.

Not all animal rights supporters agree with me, but I believe
that the only way we can be logically consistent in condoning an
experiment on an animal is if we would also condone performing
the exact same experiment on a member of our own species.

## Isn't it insulting to compare human beings with animals?

**Original URL:** https://veg1.org/humans_are_animals.html


**Isn't it insulting and inaccurate to compare human
beings with animals?**  

  

  

Human beings are animals. 98.6% of our genetic code is identical
to that of a chimpanzee. Chimpanzees are genetically closer to
human beings than they are to gorillas. In fact, chimpanzees are
even genetically closer to humans than rats are to mice.

<a id="language"></a>

## Don't only humans have the ability to use language and understand abstract concepts?

**Original URL:** https://veg1.org/language.html


**Don't only humans have the ability to use language
and understand abstract concepts?**  

  

  

Even insects possess language, since
they communicate with each other using chemicals and body
language. All animals have a language, even though they do not
speak with a human voice.

However, even the ability to speak with a human voice is not
unique to humans. There is an African gray parrot named Alex who
has learned human speech, and can consistently give correct
answers to questions he has never previously been asked, about
objects which he has never previously seen. This parrot thereby
demonstrates that he is not simply memorizing the answers, but is
engaging in analytical reasoning, and demonstrating comprehension
of abstract concepts such as shapes and numbers.

The language of many species is far more complex than we
previously realized. For example, prairie dogs make various calls
to each other which sound identical to the human ear. It is only
when these calls were recorded, and analyzed on a sound
spectrograph, that we learned that the prairie dog vocabulary was
much larger than we had ever imagined. For example, although they
all sound identical to the human ear, prairie dogs have different
calls for warning each other about the approach of a human male
and a human female. The calls are also different depending on
what color clothing the person is wearing. And, they have
different calls depending on whether or not the human is carrying
a gun.

In the past, people have complained about racial bias in the
construction of intelligence tests. We are now dealing with
something even harder to eliminate in our intelligence tests -
species bias. As one of the more obvious examples, we often judge
the intelligence of animals such as dolphins based on how many
human words they can learn and understand. However, dolphins have
a very complex language which we have, so far, been completely
unable to decipher. If dolphins were to apply this same test to
humans, then the dolphins would have to conclude that humans are
complete idiots, since despite our best efforts, we have failed
to learn even a single word that the dolphins are saying.

<a id="self_aware"></a>

## Aren't only humans self aware?

**Original URL:** https://veg1.org/self_aware.html


**Aren't only humans self aware?**  

  

  

Other animals recognize both themselves and others as
individuals. Animals clearly remember both their own and everyone
else's place in the social hierarchy. They use language to express abstract concepts.
They remember which individuals in their community are their friends. They pass on cultural information from one
generation to the next. And they mourn their dead.

In spite of all this, the evidence which finally convinces
most skeptics is the mirror experiment. This test involves
placing a mirror in front of an animal, and checking if the
animal realizes they are looking at a reflection of themselves. Various
animals, such as dolphins, chimpanzees, some birds and fish, and certain ants pass the
mirror test. Some of these animals go to great lengths to maneuver in front of the
mirror so as to closely examine parts of their bodies which they
normally can not see.

It should be pointed out that although passing the mirror test
indicates self awareness, failing the mirror test does not
indicate a lack of self awareness. For example, there were
several cases where I passed in front of a wall sized mirror, and
did not recognize my own reflection for the first minute or two.
I initially just thought that it was an interesting coincidence
that someone else was wearing the same clothes as me.
Nevertheless, this does not imply that I lacked self awareness
during these few minutes. It is possible for some animals to lack
the insight to ever be able to pass the mirror test, and yet be
completely self aware. This is especially true of animals such as dogs, 
which fail to recognize their own reflection, but succeed in recognizing their own odor.
Humans are unable to recognize their own odor, but this should not cause dogs to conclude that humans lack self awareness.

There are still some people who feel uncomfortable accepting
self awareness in other animals. This should not be surprising
when considered in historical context. During the 18th century, many European philosophers believed that black people did not possess self awareness.

Their argument was that only beings with a soul can possess self awareness. Furthermore, they argued that the test for if someone possesses a soul is whether or not they have the capacity for rational thought. They also argued that the test for the capacity for rational thought is whether or not an individual had the potential to understand a written language. The widely accepted belief at the time was that black people did not have the mental capacity to learn to read or write. Although some black people had been writing in Arabic centuries earlier, this fact was unknown to these European philosophers. Therefore, many European philosophers concluded that black people did not possess a soul, were not the descendants of Adam and Eve, and did not have the capacity for self-awareness.

It is difficult for us today to imagine how otherwise
intelligent people can actually hold such views, yet this was
once a dominant belief of educated people. Future generations may
react in similar revulsion when learning about the way in which
our present society views the mental abilities of animals.

<a id="macaques"></a>

## What evidence is there that other animals can make moral decisions?

**Original URL:** https://veg1.org/macaques.html


**What evidence is there that other animals can make
moral decisions?**   

  

  

There is evidence that humans are not the only animals capable of
making moral decisions. As one example, below is a passage from
the book S*hadows of Forgotten Ancestors*, written by Drs.
Sagan and Druyan, about an experiment performed on macaque
monkeys.

**"In the annals of primate
ethics, there are some accounts that have the ring of parable. In
a laboratory setting, macaques were fed if they were willing to
pull a chain and electrically shock an unrelated macaque whose
agony was in plain view through a one-way mirror. Otherwise, they
starved. After learning the ropes, the monkeys frequently refused
to pull the chain; in one experiment only 13% would do so - 87%
preferred to go hungry. One macaque went without food for nearly
two weeks rather than hurt its fellow. Macaques who had
themselves been shocked in previous experiments were even less
willing to pull the chain. The relative social status or gender
of the macaques had little bearing on their reluctance to hurt
others.**

**"If asked to choose between
the human experimenters offering the macaques this Faustian
bargain and the macaques themselves - suffering from real hunger
rather than causing pain to others-our own moral sympathies do
not lie with the scientists. But their experiments permit us to
glimpse in non-humans a saintly willingness to make sacrifices in
order to save others - even those who are not close kin.  By
conventional human standards, these macaques - who have never
gone to Sunday school, never heard of the Ten Commandments, never
squirmed through a single junior high school civics lesson - seem
exemplary in their moral grounding and their courageous
resistance to evil. Among these macaques, at least in this case,
heroism is the norm.**

**"If the circumstances were
reversed, and captive humans were offered the same deal by
macaque scientists, would we do as well? (Especially when there
is an authority figure urging us to administer the electric
shocks, we humans are disturbingly willing to cause pain - and
for a reward much more paltry than food is for a starving macaque
[cf. Stanley Milgram, Obedience to Authority: An Experimental
Overview].) In human history there are a precious few whose
memory we revere because they knowingly sacrificed themselves for
others. For each of them, there are multitudes who did
nothing."**

Discussing the macaque monkeys who chose to starve rather than
inflict pain on another, Drs. Sagan and Druyan conclude,
"Might we have a more optimistic view of the human future if
we were sure our ethics were up to their standards?"

To this, I would like to add that as we sit back and wonder
how we ourselves would behave if we were placed in the situation
which the macaques found themselves in, we should realize that
this scenario is not a hypothetical one for us. Every time we
make a decision of whether or not to eat meat, we are making a
decision of whether or not to inflict suffering on others for a
reward much smaller than food is for a starving monkey.

Unlike the macaques, we have the ability to alleviate our
hunger without pulling the chain. This is by eating a vegan diet, which actually happens to be much healthier for us. Therefore, every time we
make a decision to eat meat, we are making a decision of whether
or not to inflict death and suffering on others simply for the
pleasure of tasting meat - and there are very few forms of
suffering in this world which can rival that which is inflicted
on modern factory farms.

However, unlike the macaques, we are not forced to witness the
agony of our victims through a one way mirror.

<a id="animal_culture"></a>

## Don't only humans have the ability to pass on cultural information from one generation to the next?

**Original URL:** https://veg1.org/animal_culture.html


**Don't only humans have the ability to pass on
cultural information from one generation to the next?**  

  

  

Even animals like rats can pass cultural information from one
generation to the next. We know this not because we were
necessarily trying to study rat intelligence, but because rats
have long been out smarting the humans who have been trying to
poison and kill them.

This is illustrated by the following experiment which was
designed to study how to poison rats more successfully. A colony
of rats in a controlled environment was fed two types of food.
Let us call these food X and food Y. Initially, the rats ate both
types of food in equal amounts. One day, food X was poisoned with
lithium chloride. Although neither food was ever poisoned after
this one day, no rat in the colony ever ate food X again. What is
especially interesting about this, though, is that no rat in the
colony ever ate food X again even many generations later.

This colony of rats effectively had a cultural taboo which it
was passing down from one generation to the next. This taboo made
this colony of rats culturally distinct from other rat colonies
of the same species. Just as with human taboos, this taboo
persisted long after the reason for the taboo no longer existed.
But it still made sense for this taboo to be maintained. After
all, would you want to be the first rat to try food X again to
see if it was poisoned, after no one had been eating it for many
generations?

There is considerable evidence of far more complex cultural
traditions in animals, particularly with regards to tool use among primates. However, I
wanted to use rats in my example to emphasize that it is not just
primates which pass cultural traditions to future generations.

<a id="concept_of_death"></a>

## Don't only humans understand the concept of death?

**Original URL:** https://veg1.org/concept_of_death.html


**Don't only humans understand the concept of death?**  

  

  

We have direct evidence that other animals do understand the
concept of death. For example, when elephants pass the skeletal
remains of old friends during their migration, they stop and seem
to mourn. We can not be certain what these elephants are
thinking, due to the fact that we do not yet know how to
communicate with them.

However, we can communicate with animals such as chimpanzees
through sign language. There was a case where a chimpanzee infant
died during surgery, and it was the duty of the trainer to tell
the chimp's mother, in sign language, that her baby had died.
According to the trainer, it was clear that the chimpanzee mother
understood, and that she reacted in the same manner that any
human mother would.

<a id="social_contracts"></a>

## Don't only humans have the ability to enter social contracts?

**Original URL:** https://veg1.org/social_contracts.html


**Don't only humans have the ability to enter social
contracts?**  

  

  

Other animals do agree to certain types of social contracts with
each other. For example, some species of bats share the food they
find with others in their community who they are not related to.
It is not possible to force a bat to share against his will,
since this process is done by regurgitating food directly into
the mount of the recipient. Each bat remembers which individuals
in the community have helped them when they themselves were
hungry, and they remember which individuals refused to help them
in their time of need, and these bats respond in kind.

It is not unusual for a bat to be unable to find food for
several days, in which case his survival depends on having
friends. In effect, by sharing food with others, these bats are
purchasing an insurance policy. A bat with a large network of
friends is much more likely to survive - and a bat who chooses
not to honor his contracts (not help those who have helped him in
the past) will soon find himself without any friends when he is
in need of assistance.

<a id="animal_tools"></a>

## Don't only humans have the ability to use tools?

**Original URL:** https://veg1.org/animal_tools.html


**Don't only humans have the ability to use tools?**  

  

  

Humans are not the only animals who know how to use tools.

As one example, some tribes of chimpanzees use rocks to crack
open nuts. Knowledge of how to do this is passed on from one
generation to the next, as the young watch their elders.

This procedure requires using two rocks, one as an anvil, and
one as a hammer. The process of selecting the right type of rock
for the anvil and the right type of rock for the hammer, and the
process of smashing a nut between them is one which is very
tricky, and requires considerable practice. This was apparent
when a human researcher studying the chimps tried to do this
himself. It took him several hours to crack open his first nut, a
process which takes experienced chimps only a few seconds.

Other tribes of chimpanzees of the same species have not
discovered this cultural knowledge. The shells of these nuts are
too hard too be opened with their teeth, and these other tribes
therefore do not have these nuts as a part of their diet, even
though both rocks and nuts are plentiful. As different tribes of
chimpanzees interact, knowledge of varies types of tool use, such
as this one, is transmitted from one tribe to another.

I find it particularly interesting to compare how new
practices are spread in human and other primate societies. For
example, there was a case where a young female macaque monkey
discovered how to remove the sand off of fruit by washing the
fruit in the river. The first monkeys in the community to copy
the procedure were her mother and the other children. Later, the
other adult females also began to wash their fruit. The absolute
last group in the society to adopt the practice was the adult
males, and I can not help but wonder if there are any parallels
to human societies.

## Don't humans have bigger brains than all other animals?

**Original URL:** https://veg1.org/brain_size.html


**Don't humans have bigger brains than all other
animals?**   

  

  

No. The brains of animals such as elephants and blue whales are
considerably larger than the brains of humans.

Most people therefore acknowledge that intelligence is not
necessarily proportional to brain mass.

Nevertheless, many people will instead try to argue that
intelligence is proportional to the ratio of brain mass to body
mass, and will point out that humans have a much higher ratio of
brain mass to body mass than do elephants or whales. However, the
problem with this argument is that animals such as the pygmy
shrew have a ratio of brain mass to body mass which is roughly
equal to that of humans.

## What is meant by the term "rights" ?

**Original URL:** https://veg1.org/what_are_rights.html


**What is meant by the term *Rights*?**  

  

  

Many people in the world live under governments where they have
virtually no legal rights. Nevertheless, we generally believe
that these people still have basic "human rights", even
though these rights are routinely denied to them. In this sense,
when we refer to a person's "rights", we are not
referring to their legal rights. Instead, we are referring to the
moral obligations which every government and individual has
towards this person, regardless of whether or not these
obligations are being fulfilled.

It is in this same sense that people discuss animal rights. In
addition to this, the term "animal rights" has come to
signify the view that our moral obligation to animals goes far
beyond that which is acknowledged by traditional humane
societies. Traditional humane societies condemn the forms of
cruelty which are already considered to be socially unacceptable,
such as setting a cat on fire. Supporters of animal rights go
beyond this by also condemning practices which currently remain
legal - such as testing cosmetics on animals, killing animals for
their fur, and slaughtering animals for food.

## Where do rights come from?

**Original URL:** https://veg1.org/where_rights_come_from.html


**Where do rights come from?**  

  

  

There are many different views about the nature and origin of
morality. Animal rights activists have varying opinions about the
answer to this question, just as the rest of the public has
varying opinions about the answer to this question.

Some animal rights activists believe that all our ethical
guidelines are the creation of human societies, and believe that
animals should be included in our human made ethical codes. Other
animal rights activists believe that our moral laws come from
God, and believe that it is God's will for humans to include
animals in our sphere of compassion. Other animal rights
supporters have many other views.

My personal view is that objective moral laws come from the same place
that the law of gravity comes from. I explain my reasoning for
this view in my other web
page, which deals with morality in general. I need to
emphasize that the views I express there are **my own
personal opinions**, and do not necessarily reflect the
views of other animal rights supporters.

## Why should we behave better towards animals than they do towards each other?

**Original URL:** https://veg1.org/better_than_animals_behave.html


**Why should we behave better towards animals than
they do towards each other?**  

  

  

We have a duty to act morally towards others regardless of how
anyone else behaves. For example, the institution of slavery in
the United States was not in any way justified by the fact that
rival African tribes routinely conquered and enslaved one
another.

Also, it should be mentioned that the way in which humans
currently behave towards animals is actually far worse than the way in which animals
behave towards each other.

## Why do we have a moral obligation to animals who do not understand moral concepts?

**Original URL:** https://veg1.org/moral_agents.html


**Why do we have a moral obligation to animals who
do not understand moral concepts?**

There are many human beings who do not have the ability to
understand moral concepts. Examples are infants, the severely
mentally retarded, and elderly people who's minds have
deteriorated.

Nevertheless, we believe that we have an obligation to act
morally towards these individuals, even though they themselves do
not have the ability to make ethical decisions.

Incidentally, it is worth pointing out that human beings are
not the only animals capable of understanding moral concepts.

## What do we gain by respecting the rights of other animals if they do not respect our rights?

**Original URL:** https://veg1.org/gain.html


**What do we gain by respecting the rights of other
animals if they do not respect our rights?**  

  

  

There are some wild animals who respect the rights of humans.
For centuries, dolphins have been known to help drowning sailors swim to shore. There
are also countless examples of domesticated animals, such as
dogs, who risk their lives to save their adopted human family,
even though they were never trained or instructed to do so.
However, it is true that for the most part, these are the
exceptions rather than the rule.

From purely the perspective of self interest, in many cases we have
nothing at all to gain by respecting the rights of animals. Most
animals are simply not capable of returning the favor.

However, morality is not about trying to figure out how to
maximize our own selfish interests. True morality is not
displayed by a shrewd politician who acts benevolently only
because the TV cameras are watching. Nor is it displayed by
someone who is kind to others only because he expects a favor in
return. Nor is it displayed by someone who behaves a certain way
only to avoid punishment in an afterlife.

In my opinion, true morality is about acting in the interest
of others, even when we have nothing to gain in return.

## What if humans treat and slaughter the animals humanely?

**Original URL:** https://veg1.org/humane_slaughter.html


**What if humans treat and slaughter the
animals humanely?**  

  

  

Regardless of how well the animals are treated, I believe that it
is wrong, even in principle, to kill animals for food when it is
not necessary for our survival.

I personally had a very large number of family members who died in the Holocaust.
One of the reasons concentration camps were invented was to make the killing process more humane, as opposed to firing squads.
In the case of firing squads, the bullets did not necessarily make an instant kill and many people died slowly and painfully, as bodies were piled on top of each other, some living and some dead.
By contrast the poison gas of a concentration camp, by comparison, killed people much more quickly and painlessly.
Nevertheless, we are still not going to give the "Humanitarian of the Year" award to the person that invented concentration camps.

There is no such thing as a humane concentration camp and there is absolutely no such thing as a humane slaughter house.

<a id="road_kill"></a>

## What about eating road kill?

**Original URL:** https://veg1.org/road_kill.html


**What about eating road kill?**

The reason I am vegan is because I do not wish to
contribute to the death or suffering of animals. Therefore, I
have no ethical objections to eating an animal who was
accidentally killed by a car, provided that this will not
encourage anyone to kill more animals in the future.

However, although I have no ethical objections to it, I choose
not to eat road kill for a variety of other reasons. This is the
same way in which I have no ethical objections to eating rat
droppings, since this would not harm the rats in any way, but I
still prefer not to eat rat droppings for a variety of other
reasons.

<a id="harvesting_crops"></a>

## Aren't animals also killed during the harvesting of crops and the construction of roads?

**Original URL:** https://veg1.org/harvesting_crops.html


**Aren't animals also killed during the harvesting
of crops and the construction of roads?**  

  

  

Yes. I make no claims of ethical purity. I am fully aware that
rats, snakes, and various other animals are killed during the
harvesting of plants for my vegan diet. I am also aware that I am
contributing to the degradation of the environment every time I
drive my car. Being vegan is not about a quest for
personal purity, which is an unachievable goal. It is about doing
what we can not to needlessly contribute to the death and suffering of animals.

When our society takes the concept of animal rights seriously,
we will have to reform the way in which we harvest crops and
construct roads so as to try to reduce the number of animals
killed. However, this is not going to occur as long as our
society continues to view animals as just a food source. I
realize that, in some way, I am contributing to the death of
animals simply by interacting with society. However, I believe
that withdrawing from society would cause even greater harm,
because I would lose the ability to influence and encourage
others to move towards a vegan lifestyle.

Although animals are killed during the cultivation of crops
for vegan diets, it should be pointed out that far
more animals are killed during the cultivation of crops for a
meat based diet. This is because plants have to be fed to the
livestock, and only a small fraction of the food which an animal
eats is converted into meat for human consumption. Far fewer
animals would be killed during the cultivation of crops if humans
ate these crops directly, instead of feeding to these crops to
livestock.

Ultimately, regardless of how hard we try to avoid it, some
animals are always going to be accidentally killed in the course
of human events. This is the same way in which, regardless of how
hard we try, some people will always die in car accidents.
However, the fact that we might accidentally run someone over
with our car does not imply that it is ok to run them over on
purpose.

<a id="need_meat"></a>

## What about situations where humans need to eat meat to survive?

**Original URL:** https://veg1.org/need_meat.html


**What about situations where humans need to eat
meat to survive?**

This situation exists for a few cultures which have virtually
no contact with the industrialized world, and which live in
geographic areas where the native vegetation does not permit a
vegetarian diet.

I believe that the reason that it is not wrong for animals
such as lions to eat meat is because two conditions are both
simultaneously met. These conditions are that lions genuinely
need to eat meat to survive, and that the ecological balance of
the area depends on lions hunting their prey.

If both of these conditions are met for humans, as they are in
a few existing non-industrialized cultures, then I believe that
these humans are as ethically justified in hunting animals as are
lions. So I do believe that eating meat is ethically permissible
in certain hypothetical situations.

I also believe that cannibalism is ethically permissible in
certain hypothetical situations. For example, suppose a group of
people are stranded on a desert island, and they will all die of
starvation prior to being rescued unless they cannibalize each
other. In this hypothetical scenario, I believe that cannibalism
is ethically permissible.

However, the fact that eating meat may be ethically
permissible in certain hypothetical scenarios should not be an
excuse for us to engage in it when the conditions of these
scenarios clearly do not apply to us.

Although the following is probably obvious, I feel I should
emphasize that my answer to this question is my own personal
opinion (as are my answers to most other questions) and does not
necessarily represent the views of other animal rights
supporters.

<a id="chance_to_live"></a>

## If we didn't raise animals for food, then they would never have had the chance to be born and experience life at all

**Original URL:** https://veg1.org/chance_to_live.html


**If we didn't raise animals for food, then they
would never have had the chance to be born and experience life at
all.**

Considering how the vast majority of farm animals are
currently raised in modern industrialized agriculture, these
animals would have been far better off never having been born.
The best moment in these animals lives is when they finally die,
because only then does their suffering finally end.

However, if the animals are raised and slaughtered humanely,
some would say that it is better for the animals to have
experienced life for a brief time before slaughter, rather than
never have been born at all. My response to this is the
following.

Once an individual is born, we have the same obligation to act
ethically toward them as we do towards everyone else. This is not
changed by the fact that the individual would have never been
born in the first place without our intervention. This is the
reason that child abuse is immoral. Even though the child would
have never existed without his parents, this does not give his
parents the right to physically abuse him.

If we hypothetically lived in a cannibalistic society which
bred and raised a race of humans for food, then we would be
correct in condemning this practice, even though without it,
these humans would have never existed in the first place.

In spite of all this reasoning, some people insist that by
refraining from eating meat, I am guilty of depriving farm
animals the chance to be born and experience life. One way to
respond to this is to point out the inherent inefficiency of
using farm land to grow crops for livestock, instead of growing
crops consumed directly by humans. If everyone ate a vegan
diet, then a much larger human population could be sustained with
the available resources.

Therefore, if I am "guilty" of depriving farm
animals the chance to be born, then people who eat meat are
"guilty" of depriving human beings the chance to be
born and experience life.

## Why are "Free Range" farms not much better?

**Original URL:** https://veg1.org/vegan.html


In the United States, even products labeled "organic" and "free range" typically come from farms where animals are treated almost as badly as what is shown in the video, and they go to the exact same slaughterhouse as all the other animals. These labels are typically just a marketing gimmick to fool people into thinking that the animals were treated well.

The only thing the term "free range" means is that the animals have some access to the outdoors. As a result, free-range conditions typically amount to 20,000 birds crowded inside an enclosed shed containing a single exit leading to a small outdoor area, which only a tiny fraction of the birds can access at any given time, and which most of them will never realistically be able to make it to. Therefore, "free range" animals typically still go through debeaking, dehorning, tail docking, castration, etc. And they are still crowded together, and they still go to the exact same slaughterhouse as non-free range animals. And the only thing "organic" means is that the animals are not given hormones or antibiotics. Everything else is typically the same as the video.

Also, there are many "free range" and "organic" companies that claim that they treat their animals extremely well, but then when undercover videos are taken, it is shown just how horrible the conditions really are. For example, the male chicks are still thrown into a grinder, even at the "cage-free" egg farms which claim to care about animals. For most people in the United States, trying to find meat, eggs, or dairy from a place that does not treat their animals this way would require far more effort than going vegan.

In any case, no animal wants to go to the slaughterhouse.

Kosher and Halal slaughterhouses typically purchase their animals from the exact same farms that all other slaughterhouses do. So, although the slaughter process is different, the way the animals are raised is typically the same as in standard factory farming videos. Also, there have been Kosher slaughterhouses that bragged to everyone about how "humanely" they killed the animals, but when undercover investigators brought in hidden cameras, they showed just how horrible it really was.

## Are there laws requiring animals to be slaughtered humanely?

**Original URL:** https://veg1.org/Humane_Slaughter_Law.html

In the United States, the Humane Slaughter Act is rarely enforced, and large slaughterhouses will not stop the assembly lines just because the stun guns failed to work properly. According to Steve Cockerham, a USDA inspector at Nebraska slaughterhouses, and former USDA veterinarian Lester Friedlander, some U.S. slaughterhouses routinely skin live cattle, immerse squealing pigs in scalding water, and abuse still-conscious animals in other ways to keep production lines moving quickly. Cockerham said he often saw plant workers cut the feet, ears, and udders off cattle that were conscious after stun guns failed to work properly. He said, "They were still blinking and moving. It's a sickening thing to see."

Also, the Federal Humane Slaughter Act only applies to mammals, and there are no laws at all for how chickens or other birds are killed.

<a id="change_the_law"></a>

## Why don't you just focus on passing laws requiring better treatment for farm animals?

**Original URL:** https://veg1.org/change_the_law.html

In the United States, many organizations have been trying to do that for decades, but they have not been very successful. For example, there have been ballot initiatives in some states requiring that the cages for the animals have to be made slightly larger. However, even with these laws in place, most of what is shown in the factory farming videos is still legal and standard practice, and even the farms labeled "free range" and "organic" are typically not much better than what is shown there. The problem is that if more significant changes are demanded, the law is unlikely to pass, due to the fact that the industry will correctly point out that this will significantly increase the price of animal products. Also, the few laws that already do exist are rarely enforced.

There is considerable debate among animal advocates about how to best approach this problem. Many organizations are trying to pass additional legislation. Others are concerned that these laws aren't really accomplishing anything other than to create the illusion that the animals are being well treated, when nothing could be further from the truth. But, we do know that getting the public to reduce its consumption of animal products will result in fewer animals having to suffer. The number of animals which the industry breeds is directly proportional to how much meat and other animal products the public buys. So, even if we don't get "everyone" to go vegan, the more vegans there are, the fewer animals will have to go through what is shown in the videos.

## Why is eating meat wrong?

**Original URL:** https://veg1.org/cat_analogy.html


**Why is it wrong to eat meat?**

Regardless of what we think about the more controversial aspects
of animal rights, such as medical experimentation, there is a
general consensus in our society that it is ethically
reprehensible to set a cat on fire for entertainment. However,
since we do not need to eat meat to survive, when we choose to
eat meat, we are choosing to inflict death and suffering on
others simply for the pleasure of tasting meat. 
What goes on in factory farms and slaughterhouses causes at least as much suffering to animals as does setting a cat on fire for entertainment.
In both cases, all that we gain in return is just a few moments of trivial pleasure.

**Why is it wrong to eat fish?**  

  

  

Fish feel pain and suffering just as all other animals do, and just as we humans do. Also, since fish are smaller than other animals, many more die per meal. In addition, over fishing is destroying the ocean ecosystems, and driving many aquatic species towards extinction.

## Why is it wrong to eat dairy and eggs?

**Original URL:** https://veg1.org/Eggs_and_Dairy.html


**Why is it wrong to eat dairy and eggs?**  

  

  

For a cow to give milk, she must first give birth. Therefore, the cows are impregnated, and the calves are taken away from their mothers immediately after birth, so that all the milk will be consumed by humans. The male calves are either slaughtered immediately, or raised as veal. When the milk production declines, the cow is reimpregnated, and the process repeats itself. When the cow is around six years old, her milk production permanently declines, and she is sent to the slaughterhouse, even though the normal lifespan for cows is much longer.

With regards to eggs, most male chicks are killed at birth, both for caged and for cage-free eggs. Also, even the cage-free operations still crowd the hens together, cut off a portion of the birds beaks, and kill the hens when their egg production declines. 
Egg laying hens are by far the worst treated of all farm animals, far more so than the animals raised for meat.

## Meat tastes too good to become a vegan.

**Meat tastes too good to become a vegan.**  

  

  

Many people who are now vegans once thought the same thing.
However, they decided that an action does not become morally
justified simply because they enjoy doing it, and that the inconvenience of a
transition to a new lifestyle is relatively minor compared to
the amount of animal death and suffering for which they would otherwise continue to be responsible.

For people who want to become vegans without having to
give up the taste of meat, there are products such as
veggie-burgers, veggie-sausages, and veggie-bacon. These products
look and (depending on the brand) taste like meat, but are made
entirely out of plant based ingredients.

**Original URL:** https://veg1.org/farm_animal_population.html


**If everyone becomes a vegan, then what will
we do with all the farm animals?**  

  

  

Farm animals exist in such large numbers only because human
beings breed them for slaughter, often through artificial
insemination. As more people become vegan, fewer farm
animals will be bred, and their population will be reduced.

If everyone eventually becomes a vegan, then the number
of farm animals which will exist will only be a tiny fraction of
the number today.

## Aren't the animals already dead when we purchase meat in a grocery store?

**Original URL:** https://veg1.org/already_dead.html


**Aren't the animals already dead when we purchase
meat in a grocery store?**  

  

  

Yes, the animals are already dead when we purchase meat in a
grocery store. However, this is only because we are, in effect,
hiring someone to kill them for us.

The number of animals which are bred and slaughtered depends
directly on the consumer demand for animal products. Every time we refrain
from purchasing animal products, we reduce this consumer
demand, and ensure that fewer animals will be bred and forced to
suffer.

So, although the animals we are eating are already dead when
we purchase meat in a grocery store, doing so directly increases
the number of animals which will have to suffer and die in the
future.

Yes, if everyone becomes a vegan, then many people who
depend on animal agriculture will have to find a new way to earn
a living.

Several hundred years ago, many people's jobs and economic
well being depended on the continuation of the slave trade.
Nevertheless, the ethics of the situation dictated that the slave
trade should be abolished, even though this meant that these
people would have to find a new way to earn a living.

There is nothing new or unusual about the process of an entire
industry disappearing. For example, people who worked in the
horse carriage industry needed to find new jobs after cars were
invented.

## Don't the majority of people think there is nothing morally wrong with eating meat?

**Original URL:** https://veg1.org/majority.html


**Don't the majority of people think there is
nothing morally wrong with eating meat?**

This is correct. However, as discussed in the title page,
truth is not democratic.  The Earth does not become flat
just because the majority of the population thinks that it
is.

One hundred years ago, racial segregation was considered acceptable
by the majority of the United States. Two hundred years ago,
slavery was considered morally acceptable by the vast majority of
the world. Two thousand years ago, it was considered acceptable to feed innocent people to lions for public
entertainment. If you look further back, it was considered
acceptable in some parts of the world to have servants buried
alive with their recently deceased master.

In each case, morality progressed because a small number of
people looked at the ethics of their society, and concluded that
it needed to be improved. Now is no better a time to think that
we have it all figured out than were any of these other points in
history.

**Isn't eating meat a part of our cultural heritage?**  

  

  

Yes it is. To take the United States as an example, eating turkey
is a traditional part of celebrating Thanksgiving, and many
American cultural heroes were hunters. Other cultures have
similar examples.

However, not everything in our cultural heritage is something
to be proud of. To take the United States as an example once
again, George Washington and many of the founding fathers owned
slaves. The slave trade, the slaughter of the Native Americans,
and the internment camps for Japanese Americans during WWII, and
the McCarthyism during the Cold War are all parts of the American
cultural heritage and legacy.

In my opinion, one of the strengths of American culture is
that we readily admit to mistakes which were made in the past. In
our schools, we teach the darkest episodes of our history to our
children, without any defensiveness or hesitation. This stands in
sharp contrast to many other cultures around the world.

When future generations look back at our time period, the fact
that we once ate meat will simply be one of the many aspects of
our cultural heritage which we are not proud of. And in
particular, the way in which the United States currently raises animals for food will not
just be viewed as one of the darkest chapters of American
history, but it will be viewed as one of the darkest chapters in
world history.

## Haven't humans eaten meat ever since they walked the Earth?

**Haven't humans eaten meat ever since they walked
the Earth?**

Yes. However, as discussed in the title page, an activity does not become
morally justified simply because it has been going on for a long
period of time.  Slavery, genocide, rape, and torture are
all activities which have been going on since long before the
dawn of recorded human history.

Furthermore, it is interesting to note that although humans
have eaten meat throughout their history, it was a relatively
small portion of our diets up until the twentieth century. A
vegetarian diet actually bears closer resemblance to what humans
have eaten throughout most of our history than does a typical
American diet.

**If you want to be vegan, that’s fine.
But, don’t tell me what to do.**

Imagine saying to someone, “If you don’t want to
beat your dog, that’s fine. But, don’t tell me not to
beat mine.”

While we are entitled to believe what we like, we are not
entitled to treat those weaker than us however we like. If we are
responsible for harming others, people have every right to ask
that we stop.

I believe in democracy, and I have no desire to impose my beliefs
on others as a dictator. However, I do hope that the majority of
the population will eventually conclude that it is wrong to
inflict death and suffering on animals simply for the pleasure of
tasting meat. When this day comes, I hope that the practice will
be outlawed through the democratic process.

This is a view which is not shared by all animal rights
activists. Many insist that it is wrong to impose our morality on
others, even if it is done through the democratic process.
However, I would point out that when we outlaw murder, rape, and
torture, we are effectively "forcing our morality" on
those who see nothing ethically wrong with murder, rape or
torture.

Furthermore, I would point out that every time
we choose to eat meat, we are "forcing our morality" on
the animals which we send to the slaughter house.

## Shouldn't we focus on solving human problems before worrying about animals?

**Original URL:** https://veg1.org/human_problems_first.html


**Shouldn't we focus on solving human problems
before worrying about animals?**  

  

  

I personally had a very large number of family members who died in the Holocaust. 
If there is something more important than ending a Holocaust, please let me know what it is, and I will go and do it.

There are indeed many dire human problems which need immediate
attention. However, going vegan does not in any way
take away from our ability to address these problems. On the
contrary, since a vegetarian diet is less expensive than one
which includes meat, this leaves people with more money to spend
on the issues which they believe are the most important.

Also, going vegan directly helps reduce world
hunger. Only a small fraction of the food which is consumed by an
animal is converted into meat for human consumption. If the land
which grows food for livestock was instead used to grow crops
consumed directly by humans, then far more food would be
available for the world's poor.

Aside from the issue of veganism, there is also the issue
of the money people spend on animals. I believe that it is indeed
appropriate to criticize the way in which the citizens of
affluent countries choose to spend their money. However,
criticism of money spent on the alleviation of animal suffering
is not what should be coming to mind.

People routinely spend money on items such as expensive cars
and jewelry, when this money can instead be given to
organizations such as UNICEF (United Nations Children's Fund).
Instead of criticizing money spent on animals, we should try to
remember our concern for global human poverty when deciding if to
purchase a new TV or go on an expensive vacation.

## How can some animal rights activists believe that other animals are our equals?

**Original URL:** https://veg1.org/animal_equality.html


**How can some animal rights activists believe that
other animals are our equals?**  

  

Before answering this, I need to first emphasize that this
is a view which is not shared by many animal rights activists.
For example, there are some animal rights activists who hold the
view that only human beings are made in the image of God.

However, I myself do believe that other animals are our equals
in some sense, and I would like to explain the reasoning behind
this.

We often like to say that all human beings are created equal,
and this is a statement I strongly agree with. However, we need
to stop and ask ourselves what we mean by the phrase "all
human beings are created equal." Do we mean that all human
beings have equal intelligence, equal creativity, and equal
physical abilities? If this is what we mean, then we are clearly
in trouble, since we are not all equal in these regards. For
example, a severely mentally retarded human clearly has less
intelligence than you or I do.

However, I still believe that it is accurate to say that all
human beings are created equal in the sense that all human beings
deserve equal compassion, and equal ethical consideration, in
spite of their inequalities in these other areas. If we extend
this type of "equality" to severely mentally retarded
humans, then we must also extend it to other species. This is
because the animals which we kill for food, clothing, and
experimentation have a considerably higher level of intelligence,
and capacity for social interaction, than do many severally
mentally retarded humans who we correctly recognize as our
equals.

Most importantly, other animals feel pain and suffering just
as we do, and they value their lives just as we value ours.

**Isn't it wrong for vegans to act as if they
are better than others and try to convert people?**  

  

  

There are many factors that determine a person's moral character, such as how
much they give to charity, their honesty, and how they treat the people
they interact with. There are, no doubt, some vegans who
exhibit a considerably worse overall moral character than do meat
eaters. Nevertheless, considering the amount of death and suffering which we
directly cause when we choose to consume animal products, the decision to move towards a vegan lifestyle, in my opinion, is one of the most
important moral decisions we will ever make.

The reason I follow a vegan lifestyle is not to feel superior to
others, but to reduce animal death and suffering. To this end, my influence
on others is at least as important as the economic impact my
purchasing decisions make. I believe that it is important for all
of us (vegans included) to recognize the fact
that we ourselves are not ethically pure, and to not have a
condescending or "holier than thou" attitude.

We should all also try to not be offended when someone
politely suggests to us that a commonly accepted practice is
immoral. If everyone refrained from offering such criticism for
fear of offending someone, then institutions such as slavery
would have continued to exist down to today. Slave owners
certainly viewed themselves as good and moral people, and they
strongly resented any implications to the contrary.

This the same way in which some people today take offense at
the suggestion that eating meat is immoral, given what this
implies about the ethics of our lifestyles. It is only human
nature for some of us to react this way. However, I believe we
all need to try to not view criticisms of widely accepted
practices as personal attacks on ourselves, but instead
rationally evaluate these criticisms with an open mind, just as
we would have wanted earlier generations to rationally evaluate
criticisms of slavery and segregation.

**What do animal rights activists think about
abortion?**

Some animal rights activists are pro-choice. Others are pro-life. Opposing abortion does not require supporting cruelty towards animals.

## Doesn't duty to our own kind come first?

**Original URL:** https://veg1.org/holocaust.html


**Doesn't duty to our own kind come first?**  

  

  

It is unfortunate that it is a part of human nature to have less
compassion for those who are different from us than we do for our
own kind. The question people have often asked themselves is what
precisely is meant by the term "our own kind." Is it
those who are of the same nationality? Is it those who are of the
same race or religion? Is it those who are of the same tribe? Or
is it those who are of the same species?

In my opinion, the species boundary is no less arbitrary than
are any of these others. In fact, I would like to tell the story
of a holocaust survivor who immigrated to the United States, and
rented an apartment above a slaughter house. He said that what he
saw in that slaughter house every day was precisely the reason he
left Nazi Germany - indifference to the suffering of others
simply because they are believed to be different from us.

<a id="family_history"></a>

## What was your family history during the Holocaust?

**Original URL:** https://veg1.org/family_history.html

**What was your family history during the Holocaust?**  

  

  

I personally had a very large number of family members who died in the Holocaust.
I was born in the Soviet Union and my entire family is ethnically Jewish.
My grandmother came from a very large family with many cousins, aunts, and uncles.
Yet she is the only one who survived the war because she was away serving as a nurse in the Soviet Army when her hometown was occupied.

Her mother and sister were able to hide thanks to the help of the janitor of their apartment complex.
However, when one of their neighbors alerted the soldiers that there were Jews hiding in the janitor's supply room, they were killed by firing squad.
Also killed by firing squad was the janitor who had risked his life to do the right thing.

I was born long after the war was over.
But the city I was born in, Kiev, is the site of one of the largest massacres of the Second World War.
Kiev had a very large Jewish population, roughly similar to the Jewish population of Chicago.
When the Germans arrived, they had the Jews line up in front of the entire town and then they were marched off and killed by firing squad.

At least according to what my family tells me, the vast majority of the local population was very happy about what was happening.
Anti-semitism was very strong in this part of the world and
the Germans would have never been able to be successful with what they did if it had not been for the enthusiastic support and cooperation of the local population, 
because these were the people who were making sure that the Jews could not escape or run away.

The lesson to be learned from this, I believe, is that it is not just the people pulling the triggers who are responsible.

In the case of factory farms and slaughterhouses, the people in the videos are only doing what we are paying them to do on our behalf.
If we were not buying their products, none of this would be happening.
The number of animals which the industry breeds, tortures, and kills depends directly on consumer demand,
with every person's choices affecting hundreds of animals.

The people who chose to do the right thing in the 1940's were risking their lives, yet many did so anyway.
The people who choose to do the right thing today are only risking ridicule from their family and friends.

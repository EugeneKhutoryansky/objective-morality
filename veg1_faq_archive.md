Animal Rights
and Vegan Ethics

**[Click Here for the List of Questions](Questions.html)**

![](http://veg1.org/Animals-II-Print-C10069671.jpg) 

Written by [Eugene Khutoryansky](about_me.html) 

The purpose of this web page is to answer the most commonly
asked questions about animal rights.
  

  

Before I begin, I believe that it is important to put the topic
of animal rights into historical perceptive. One hundred years ago,
racial segregation was considered acceptable in the United
States. Two hundred years ago, slavery was considered morally
acceptable by the vast majority of the world. Two thousand years
ago, it was considered acceptable to feed innocent
people to lions for public entertainment. 

In each case, morality progressed because a small number of
people looked at the ethics of their society, and concluded that
it needed to be improved. Now is no better a time to think that
we have it all figured out than were any of these other points in
history. Simply put, truth is not democratic.  The Earth
does not become flat just because the majority of the population
thinks that it is.  Nor does an activity become morally
justified just because it has been going on for a long
time.  Slavery, genocide, rape, and torture are all
activities which have been going on since long before the dawn of
recorded human history.

In this web page, I am going to present logical arguments for
claims which, at present, most people do not agree with. 
For example, I am going to be arguing that it is immoral to kill animals for food or
clothing.  Many people today view such claims as
extreme.  However, if a person several thousand years ago
had argued for the abolition of slavery, or the abolition of
gladiatorial combat, they would have received the same reaction.

## What about how other animals kill and eat each other?

**Original URL:** https://veg1.org/other_animals_kill_each_other.html


**What about how other animals kill and eat
each other?**  

  

  

There is a big distinction between the situation when a lion eats meat, and the situation when a human eats meat. Lions can not decide to live on grain and vegetables. A lion must eat meat or die. A vegan diet for humans, on the other hand, is actually healthier than one which includes meat. Whereas lions must eat meat to survive, humans eat meat simply for the pleasure of tasting meat.

There is another significant difference between lions and
humans.  Lions do not raise their prey on factory farms, where animals are forced to
endure a lifetime of suffering and confinement.

## Human beings are a part of the food chain, and eating meat is natural. So then, how can it be wrong?

**Original URL:** https://veg1.org/meat_is_natural.html


**Human beings are a part of the food chain,
and eating meat is natural. So then, how can eating meat be
wrong?**  

  

  

Eating meat is indeed natural in the sense that other animals do
it as well. In fact, it is even done on occasion by our closest
living relatives, the chimpanzees. However, there are many other
things which are also natural. For example, chimpanzee males
sometimes rape the females in their tribe. Chimpanzees sometimes
engage in organized warfare against other tribes with which they
compete for territory. A chimpanzee male, in a moment of rage,
sometimes picks up a nearby infant, and crushes his skull against
a rock. And chimpanzees do on occasion eat meat, and they do on
occasion engage in cannibalism, in spite of the fact that there
is a plentiful supply of food from other sources.

So eating meat is indeed absolutely natural. However, the fact
that it is natural does not imply that it is ethically
permissible. If we believed that eating meat was ethically
permissible simply because other animals did it as well, then
this would imply that there is nothing wrong with rape, [cannibalism](cannibalism.html), or infanticide, all of
which routinely occurs throughout the animal kingdom.

The truth of the matter is that other animals share the
darkest aspects of our humanity, as well as [those aspects of which we are the most proud](macaques.html).

<a id="survival_of_the_fittest"></a>

## What do you think about the phrase "survival of the fittest"?

**Original URL:** https://veg1.org/survival_of_the_fittest.html


**What do you think about the phrase "survival
of the fittest"?**  

  

  

The phrase "survival of the fittest" describes the
process of natural selection which has been occurring on our
planet for the past several million years, but it is not a
prescription for our ethical guidelines. Consider our ethics with
regards to other human beings. We care for the weak and the sick,
as well as for the strong and the healthy. We take care of the
elderly and the infirm, and do not simply leave them to die
outside in the cold.

Also, we should keep in mind that "survival of the
fittest" has nothing to do with the way in which we
currently kill animals for food. This is because all farm animals
are eventually sent to the slaughter house, regardless of how fit
they are. In fact, humans have altered farm animals through
selective breeding to enhance characteristics humans find
desirable, even though these characteristics significantly reduce
the "fitness" of the animals. For example, turkeys have
been selectively bred to produce large breasts, which consumers
prefer. However, the breasts have now become so large that the
turkeys are no longer able to mount each other and reproduce
naturally. As a result, all commercially bred turkeys in the U.S.
can reproduce only through artificial insemination.

Survival of the fittest also has little to do with the way in
which humans currently kill animals through hunting. Whereas
predators like wolves are more likely to kill young and weak
animals, a hunter's riffle does not necessarily make such a
distinction. On the contrary, a human hunter may actually prefer
to kill a strong and healthy animal because he makes a better
trophy.

<a id="prevent_predation"></a>

## Should we try to prevent other animals from killing and eating each other?

**Original URL:** https://veg1.org/prevent_predation.html


**Should we try to prevent other animals from
killing and eating each other?**

If we attempted to do this, it would result in an ecological
disaster. It is necessary for animals such as lions to hunt in
order for an ecological balance to be maintained. If all lions
stopped hunting, it would be extremely detrimental to many of the
species in the area, including the prey species itself. The harm
done from the resulting ecological catastrophe would far outweigh
any good which may have been done by saving a few gazelle from
being eaten by lions.

By contrast, farm animals exist in such large numbers only because humans breed them for slaughter, in numbers proportional to consumer demand, and animal agriculture is one of the leading causes of wildlife habitat destruction. Whereas lions and tigers help the environment and ecology by eating meat, we humans greatly harm the environment and ecology every time we purchase meat.

<a id="cannibalism"></a>

## How common is cannibalism in the animal kingdom?

**Original URL:** https://veg1.org/cannibalism.html


**How common is cannibalism in the animal kingdom?**

Cannibalism is quite common among animals. Lions eat other
lions, bears eat other bears, and chimpanzees eat other
chimpanzees. This is not necessarily the result of a food
shortage. Such incidents occur even when there is a plentiful
supply of food from other sources. In the case of lions, for
example, a male lion sometimes kills and eats the cubs of a
female lion without a partner to protect her. The male lion does
this because the female lion will not mate as long as she has
cubs, but she will mate after the cubs are dead. For some
species, cannibalism is extremely common. Approximately one fifth
of the diet of a tiger salamander, for example, consists of other
tiger salamanders.

The point to be learned from this is that we should not be
basing our moral code on the behavior of other animals, but
instead strive for something better. If we were to believe that
eating meat is OK simply because other animals did it as well,
then this would imply that there is also nothing wrong with
cannibalism.

<a id="deer_overpopulation"></a>

## Isn't hunting by humans necessary to prevent deer overpopulation?

**Original URL:** https://veg1.org/deer_overpopulation.html


**Isn't hunting by humans necessary to prevent deer
overpopulation?**

In many cases, when people claim there is deer overpopulation,
what is really going on is that some residents are upset that
deer are eating the flowers on their front lawn, when in reality
there is no overpopulation problem - with the possible exception
of human overpopulation.

Nevertheless, there are some cases where there genuinely is a
severe deer overpopulation problem. Some communities have
successfully dealt with this situation through deer sterilization
programs. The primary problem with this approach is that it costs
between $200 and $300 per deer, and most communities are
unwilling to pay this cost.

However, we should realize that the most overpopulated species
on the planet is us humans, and no other species adversely
affects the environment as much as we do. However, we generally
do not consider it to be an ethically acceptable solution to kill
the excess human population. We try to address our own
overpopulation problem by reducing our birth rate, not by
increasing our death rate. Similarly, I believe that this is also
the ethically preferable solution for dealing with deer
overpopulation.

<a id="eating_their_food"></a>

## If you care about animals, then why are you eating all their food?

**Original URL:** https://veg1.org/eating_their_food.html


**If you care about animals, then why are you eating all their food?**  

  

  

As more people go vegan, this will mean that there will be more food available for animals to eat, and not less. This is due to the fact that animal agriculture is one of the leading causes of wildlife habitat destruction. Farm animals exist in such large numbers only because humans breed them for slaughter, in numbers proportional to consumer demand, and only a small fraction of the food that an animal eats is converted into food for human consumption. Therefore, growing crops to feed livestock inherently requires far more land and resources than does growing crops consumed directly by humans, to feed the same number of people. Much native wildlife habitat is destroyed to grow crops fed to livestock, and the amount by which this happens depends on the number of people eating meat and other animal products.

  

  

Animal agriculture also destroys native wildlife habitat as the result of the runoff from the concentrated animal waste from the farms, and as the result of the greenhouse gas emissions leading to global warming. Animal agriculture emits more green house gasses than do all the cars and trucks on the planet combined. As more people go vegan, more wildlife habitat is saved, and more food is therefore available for the animals.

<a id="dominion"></a>

## Doesn't the Bible say that humans have dominion over the animals?

**Original URL:** https://veg1.org/dominion.html


**Doesn't the Bible say that humans have
dominion over the animals?**  

  

  

Yes, the Bible states this in the story of Genesis after God
creates Adam and Eve and the Garden of Eden. Although I myself
believe in the theory of evolution, there are some vegans
and animal rights activists who do believe in the literal
interpretation of the Bible. These individuals would point out
that according to the literal interpretation of Genesis, no
animal ever died in the Garden of Eden prior to the original sin. Therefore, in the Garden
of Eden, Adam and Eve and all the animals were vegetarians.

In this context, the phrase "dominion over the
animals" could not have referred to killing and eating them.
Many would argue that "dominion" is more accurately
interpreted as "stewardship" rather than tyranny.
Furthermore, since the Garden of Eden represents the highest
ethical ideal, some people who believe in the literal
interpretation of the Bible interpret this to mean that
veganism is the highest ethical ideal.

In any case, the torture of animals is considered an abomination in every major religion. 
Yet this is precisely what virtually every person in our society is doing, given how modern animal agriculture industry presently operates. 
If we pay people in the industry to do this on our behalf, then we are just as responsible as they are. 
Today, even the farms labeled "Free Range" and "Organic" are typically not much better than standard factory farms.
One can not sincerely claim to follow the Bible, the Torah, or the Quran, and then continue on with business as usual on this matter.

<a id="leviticus"></a>

## Doesn't the Bible specifically state that it is ok to kill animals for food?

**Original URL:** https://veg1.org/leviticus.html


**Doesn't the Bible specifically state that it is ok
to kill animals for food?**  

  

  

Yes, it does. In particular, Exodus and Leviticus of the Old Testament give
very specific rules for how animals are to be slaughtered and
which animals can be eaten. Exodus and Leviticus are also the sections of the
Old Testament which specifically state that slavery is
permitted, and which give very specific rules for how slaves are
to be treated. During the movement to abolish human slavery, many
abolitionists were accused of going against the will of God, due
to the fact that slavery is specifically condoned by the Bible. Nevertheless, the movement to abolish human slavery included
many Bible believing Christians, as does the modern animal rights
movement.

The word "slave" in the Bible meant the same thing that it does today, as can be seen from the following passages.

People who believe in the literal interpretation of the
Bible are often troubled by these types of passages in the Old
and New Testaments. The following is one possible explanation
which some of them can offer. A society can absorb only a limited amount of change at one
time. It could be argued that God knew that if he commanded
humans to abolish slavery and abolish the practice of killing
animals for food, then this would simply be too great a shock for
society to accept all at once, and most people would just end up
ignoring the commandments altogether. Therefore, by giving
specific rules for how slaves are to be treated, and for how
animals are to be slaughtered, it could be argued that God made
these practices considerably less barbaric than they would have
been otherwise - although his real intention was for people to
one day eventually realize that the message of compassion should
be applied to all beings, including slaves and animals.

<a id="animal_soul"></a>

## Don't only human beings have a soul?

**Original URL:** https://veg1.org/animal_soul.html


**Don't only human beings have a soul?**  

  

  

There are some people who believe in the 
view that only human beings are made "in the image of
God" and that only humans have souls. Although I personally
do not agree with this view, this view is held by some
vegans and animal rights activists. Vegans with this
view would point out that regardless of whether or not animals
possess a soul, animals still feel pain and suffering just as we
do, and animals still value their lives just as we value ours.
Therefore, many of the people who believe that only humans have
souls still agree with the principle that it is wrong to inflict
death and suffering on animals simply for the pleasure of tasting
meat.

Although it is possible to believe in animal rights while
still adhering to the view that only humans have souls, I
would like to point out what the major world religions actually say on this topic.

According to the Bible, the Torah, and the Quran, a soul is required to be able to make moral decisions,
and a soul is required to be able to know the difference between good and evil.

And according to modern science, we now know that other animals do know right from wrong.
In fact, they sometimes know it much better than we humans do.

**Original URL:** https://veg1.org/roman_shops.html


**Doesn't the Bible state that a weak person eats only vegetables, and not to pass judgement on those who eat meat?**  

  

  

The Bible passage in Romans 14:1-23 is regarding a dispute about whether Jews were obligated to avoid all meat purchased in Roman stores, due to a concern that the meat was made "unclean" by being in the presence of Roman idols. This passage was stating that only a person who is "weak in faith" would be afraid that the food can be spiritually contaminated by being in the presence of Roman idols, and that Jews who want to avoid food from Roman shops for this reason should not pass judgement on those Jews who do not avoid food from Roman shops. This was a major issue for Jews living in Rome at the time, because the only meat they had access to was from Roman shops, and many chose to avoid all meat altogether for this reason.

## What about the passage where God tells Peter to "Kill and eat"?

**Original URL:** https://veg1.org/book_of_acts.html


**What about the passage where God tells Peter to Kill and eat?**  

  

  

Most Christian scholars interpret the "Kill and Eat" passage in the Book of Acts as a message 
from God telling Peter that the message of Christ was not just for the Jews, who followed the 
Kosher dietary laws, but that the message of Christ was for all of humanity. That is, most Christian 
scholars do not interpret this phrase literally.

## What about the animal sacrifices in the Bible?

**Original URL:** https://veg1.org/Animal_Sacrifice.html


**What about the animal sacrifices in the Bible?**  

  

  

Even if we do not believe in animal rights, it is still difficult to explain the animal sacrifices in the Bible, as it is unclear why an infinitely powerful God would benefit from the activity.
There are many passages in the Bible that are difficult to explain, both with regards to the treatment of humans and animals. For example, consider the passage below.
  

  

1 Samuel 15:3   

"Now go, attack the Amalekites and totally destroy all that belongs to them. Do not spare them; put to death men and women, children and infants, cattle and sheep, camels and donkeys."
  

  

I am just pointing out that there are issues theologians have had to struggle with for centuries, and they often admit that they don't have any good answers.
Nevertheless, the existence of these passages in the Bible is not viewed as an excuse for us today to kill other humans needlessly. Similarly, these passages should also not be viewed as an excuse to engage in cruelty towards animals or to kill animals needlessly.

Animals were not created for humans any more than women were
created for men, or any more than black people were created for
white people. It is difficult to understand why a compassionate
God would create beings capable of feeling pain, suffering, and a
desire to live, if their only purpose in life was to suffer and
die at the hands of humans.

## What about killing plants?

**Original URL:** https://veg1.org/killing_plants.html


**What about killing plants?**  

  

  

It is not wrong to eat plants for the same reason that it is not
wrong to kill bacteria. Every time I brush my teeth, I kill
thousands of bacteria, yet I see nothing wrong with doing
so.

The distinguishing characteristic between animals and bacteria
is that animals are conscious beings capable of feeling pain and
suffering.  Animals are capable of feeling happiness, joy,
and sorrow.  Animals are capable of feeling a desire to
live.

Bacteria, on the other hand, just like plants, and just like
rocks, do not possess anything similar to a nervous system, nor
do they exhibit any behavior which would indicate that they
possess consciousness. Bacteria are not capable of feeling pain
or suffering. Bacteria are not capable of feeling a desire to
live. Bacteria, just like plants, and just like rocks, are not
capable of feeling anything whatsoever.

When you kick a rock, you do not have to worry about whether
or not you are inflicting suffering on the rock, or interfering
with the rock's desire to live, since rocks are incapable of such
feelings. It is for this reason that it is not immoral to kick
rocks, and it is for this same reason that it is not immoral to
eat plants.

## How do you know that plants can not feel pain?

**Original URL:** https://veg1.org/plant_consciousness.html


**How do you know that plants can not feel pain?**

I believe that our consciousness is intimately connected to
our brain and nervous system. By the term
"consciousness", I am referring to the ability to feel
sensations such as pain, suffering, and a desire to live. Once a
person is brain dead, he is no longer able to feel such
sensations. Therefore, since plants do not possess anything even
remotely resembling a nervous system, I believe it is extremely
unlikely that plants can feel pain or suffering.

Furthermore, plants do not exhibit any behavior which would indicate consciousness, nor does the ability to feel pain give plants an evolutionary survival advantage. An animal's survival depends on reacting to situations which may cause pain and suffering. On the other hand, plants can not run away from a predator, nor can plants change their position to avoid a forest fire. Therefore, it is unlikely that plants would develop the ability to feel pain when it confers no survival advantage.

Plants have the ability to react to an outside stimulus, such as responding with a chemical defense when they are being eaten by insects. However, even a brain dead human will respond in the same way, in that the body will exhibit a chemical defense when doctors try to harvest the organs for donation. However, without a functioning brain, there is no pain or consciousness present. The same is most likely true in the case of plants.

**What would you do if we hypothetically discovered
that plants do indeed feel pain?**

As it turns out, even if a person's primary goal in life is to
minimize the number of plants which are killed, they should still
become a vegan.

This is because plants have to be fed to the livestock, and
meat production is extremely inefficient.  Only a small
fraction of the food which is eaten by animals is converted into
meat for human consumption.  Therefore, by eating meat, not
only do we cause animal death and suffering, we also end up
killing many more plants than we would if we ate a vegan
diet.

## Don't plants move their leaves to follow the sun?

**Original URL:** https://veg1.org/plants_move_leaves.html


**Don't plants move their leaves to follow the sun?**  

  

  

Yes. This indicates that plants have the ability to react to an
outside stimulus. However, a simple response to an outside
stimulus does not, in and of itself, indicate the ability to feel
pain. As an example, an electric doorbell can also respond to an
outside stimulus. It detects the pressure of a human finger, and
it responds by ringing. However, the fact that the doorbell can
react this way to the presence of your finger does not imply that
the doorbell is conscious. Similarly, the ability of plants to
move their leaves to follow the sun does not, in and of itself,
indicate consciousness.

**Aren't there some religions which believe that
plants possess a soul?**

Yes. This is particularly true of certain religions which
believe that after we die, we are reincarnated as plants or
animals. Many of these religions state that a plant's soul spends
its entire life in a state similar to what we are in when we are
in deep sleep. When we are in deep sleep, we are not aware of our
surroundings, nor are we dreaming. Therefore, many people who
believe that plants possess a soul do not have a problem
accepting that plants are incapable of feeling pain or a desire
to live.

## How do you know that other animals can feel pain?

**Original URL:** https://veg1.org/animal_consciousness.html


**How do you know that other animals can feel pain?**  

  

  

We know that other animals feel pain in the same way that we know
that other human beings feel pain. We do not need words to
understand the suffering of a famine victim whose language we do
not understand. Through their physical reactions, we try to infer
the pain of other human beings, even though we can never
ascertain it with absolute certainty.

We know how we ourselves react to situations which cause us
pain. When other animals, or other humans, are subjected to these
same conditions, they exhibit the same physical responses that we
do. Regardless of what we might think about the alleged
superiority of humans over animals in all other areas, when it
comes to the ability to feel pain and suffering, other animals
will forever be our equals.

## Where in the animal kingdom does consciousness begin?

**Original URL:** https://veg1.org/where_consciousness_begins.html


**Where in the animal kingdom does consciousness
begin?**  

  

  

No one can answer this question with any degree of certainty.
However, the animals which humans kill for food and clothing [clearly are conscious](animal_consciousness.html).
Therefore, the fact that we do not know precisely the location of
the demarcation line should not be an excuse for us to continue
to kill animals for food.

Nevertheless, it is interesting to speculate about where in
the animal kingdom consciousness begins. It is important to point
out that by the term "consciousness", I am simply
referring to the ability to feel sensations like pain or hunger.
Consciousness is not necessarily related to intelligence.

A severely mentally retarded human is just as conscious as is
anyone else. The fact that a severely mentally retarded human
does not have the capacity to understand multivariable calculus
doe not imply that he feels pain or suffering any less than we
do. On the other hand, a programmable calculator might be
extremely good at multivariable calculus, but possess no
consciousness whatsoever.

My personal opinion, although I can not prove it, is that the
demarcation line for consciousness lies somewhere in the [insect](insects.html) world. I believe that at least
some types of insects do possess the capacity to feel pain, and I
do include insects in my animal rights philosophy.

## Is it ok to kill animals which do not possess consciousness?

**Is it ok to kill animals which do not possess
consciousness?**  

  

  

If it turns out that a certain animal species do not possess consciousness, then from an ethical perspective I
believe that this would imply that they fall into the same
category as plants.

In some cases, we may wish to refrain from killing such
animals for environmental and ecological reasons, just as we may
wish to refrain from killing certain plants for these same
concerns.

However, I see nothing wrong in principle with killing an
animal for food if the animal possesses no more consciousness
than does a plant or a brain dead human.

## What about insects?

**Original URL:** https://veg1.org/insects.html


**What about insects?**

I include insects in my animal rights philosophy. I try to
avoid accidentally stepping on insects. Also, when I find an
insect in my home, I try to carefully carry the insect outside
without injuring him.

With regards to animal rights, the distinguishing
characteristic between plants and animals is that animals possess
consciousness, whereas [plants
do not](plant_consciousness.html). Although I can not prove it with absolute 100%
certainty, I believe that at least certain insects are also
conscious. By this, I do not mean that insects discuss
philosophy, but simply that they feel sensations such as pain and
hunger. For this reason, I believe we should include insects in
our sphere of compassion.

It is true that regardless of how hard we try, we are
inevitably going to accidentally kill some insects during our
lifetimes. It is also true that regardless of how hard we try,
some people are going to be killed in car accidents. However, the
fact that we might run over someone with our car by accident does
not imply that it is ok to run them over on purpose.

There are non-lethal methods for removing insects. Many of these

**Do you view the killing of an insect as the moral
equivalent of killing a bird or mammal?**  

  

  

Although I include insects in my animal rights philosophy, I
recognize that there are important differences between insects
and animals such as birds and mammals. One, for example, is the
fact that many insects have extremely short life spans.

The importance of this can be illustrated through the
following example. Suppose you were in a burning building, and
could only save one of two individuals. One of these individuals
is a terminally ill patient who only has several days to live,
even if he is rescued. The other individual, however, is young
and healthy. I believe that the choice in this case is fairly
simple.

Given the fact that the entire life span of some insects is
only a few days, this is the same principle I would apply if I
had to choose between saving a mammal or saving an insect.

## Don't insects only behave on an instinctual level?

**Original URL:** https://veg1.org/insect_instinct.html


**Don't insects only behave on an instinctual level?**  

  

  

Many insects do behave on only an instinctual level. However,
there are also insects which exhibit learned behavior. This is
especially true of social insects such as bees. For example, bees
must learn and remember the location of food, and communicate
this to the other bees in the hive - and this example is rather
simple compared to some of the more complex tasks which bees do,
such as the democratic process through which a group of bees
selects a location for a new hive.

To find a location for a hive, many different scouts go out
searching. When they return, they communicate to the other bees
the location and desirability of the site which they found. The
scouts then go out again and investigate a location which other
bees had indicated were desirable. At this point, each scout
decides whether or not this new location is preferable to the one
which she herself found. When she returns back, she will
communicate this to the rest of the hive. This process repeats
itself, and each bee will continue to change her allegiance from
one potential site to another. Eventually, certain sites will
become much more popular among the bees than any of the others.
The greater the number of bees which prefer a particular
location, the more likely the scouts are to investigate this
location and judge for themselves. In this way, the hive
eventually reaches a consensus, and selects a location for their
new home.

Some people will, no doubt, accuse me of using
anthropomorphizing terminology in describing this process, and I
am certainly guilty of this. However, it would be much more
difficult to describe this process if I was not allowed to use
phrases referring to what the bees "believe" or
"decide".

In any case, what this story demonstrates is that there is
more to insect behavior than just instinct. Instinctual behavior
consists of repeating the same motions regardless of past
experience. However, these bees clearly do take into account what
they remember from their previous scouting missions, and they
make complex decisions.

It is interesting to note that in order for this process of
consensus to work, each bee has to be willing to objectively
decide on the desirability of a site, regardless of whether or
not this is a site which she herself found. If humans were to try
to repeat this process, humans would have difficulty exhibiting
such impartiality. Unfortunately, human nature is such that we
tend to prefer the option which we ourselves found, regardless of
whether or not it is the best one.

## Do ants recognize their reflection in a mirror?

**Do ants recognize their reflection in a mirror?**  

  

  

The following is quoted from the website   

<https://www.animalcognition.org/2015/04/15/list-of-animals-that-have-passed-the-mirror-test/>

In 2015, scientists published research that suggests some ants can recognize themselves when looking in a mirror. When viewing other ants through glass, ants didn't divert from their normal behaviors.

However, their behavior did change when they were put in front of a mirror. The ants would move slowly, turn their heads back and forth, shake their antennae, and touch the mirror. They'd retreat and re-approach the mirror. Sometimes they would groom themselves.

The ants were next given a classic mirror test. The team of researchers would use blue dots to mark the clypeus of some of the ants, which is a part of their face near their mouths.

When in an environment without mirrors, these ants would behave normally, and wouldn't touch the markings. But this changed when they could see their reflections in a mirror. The ants with blue dots on their face would groom and appear to try to remove the markings.

Very young ants, and other ants with brown dots that blended in with the color of their face didn't clean themselves. Interestingly, neither did ants with blue dots put on the back of their heads.

When put in the company of those with blue-dotted faces, other ants would respond aggressively, presumably because the difference caused them to think the blue-dotted ant was an outsider (not a member of their colony). All of this lead the researchers to conclude that the clypeus is a species-specific physical characteristic that is important for group acceptance.

Given that these ants tried to clean the mark rather than respond aggressively, the ants likely didn't think their reflection was just another ant. The team thinks their study shows that self-recognition is not an "unrealistic" ability in ants.

## Would you rather save your child or your dog?

**Original URL:** https://veg1.org/your_child_or_your_dog.html


**What if you were in a burning building and
could only save your child or your dog?**  

  

  

It is true that most people would save their child from a burning
building before they save a dog.  Most people would
also save their own child before they save the child of a
stranger.  These actions are not necessarily immoral. 
However, this does not imply that it is OK to experiment on
other people's children in order to find a cure for your own.

The important thing to remember is that in many cases, there
are [alternative methods](medical_alternatives.html)
for performing medical research without testing on animals, and
that the animals used in these experiments often suffer a fate
far worse than death.  For example, a common practice for
those who use dogs in their research is to remove the dog's vocal
cords so that the researchers will not be bothered by the dog's
screaming.

However, regardless of what we think about the more
controversial aspects of animal rights, such as medical
experimentation on animals, we should keep in mind that [veganism is not a case of
choosing between saving your child or your dog](cat_analogy.html).

One example is in-vitro studies, where experiments are performed
on cell and tissue cultures, instead of on animals. Another
example is computer simulations which predict the toxicity of
chemicals based on their molecular structure. Other examples
include epidemiologic studies and clinical research.

Even researchers who strongly advocate the continued use of
animal testing generally agree that the number of animal tests
can be significantly reduced if alternative methods were used
more widely.

## Do animal rights supporters refrain from using life saving drugs which were developed through animal testing?

**Original URL:** https://veg1.org/refrain_from_drugs.html


**Do animal rights supporters refrain from
using life saving drugs which were developed through animal
testing?**

A few of them do. However, I personally do not believe that
this is ethically required.

To explain, let us hypothetically suppose that while the Nazis
were experimenting on prisoners during World War II, they had
discovered the cure to cancer. Hypothetically suppose that the
question before us, now that the Nazis have been defeated, is
what to do with this cure. Should we use it, or should we discard
it?

My answer to this question is an extremely controversial one,
and it is one which many other animal rights activists and
vegans strongly disagree with. My answer is use it. I
believe that it would make no sense to discard the cure for
cancer simply because it was obtained in an unethical way. We can
condemn the means through which the Nazis discovered it, and vow
to never repeat their mistakes, while at the same time use this
cure to save as many lives as possible.

This is also my attitude with regards to the use of life
saving drugs which were developed through animal testing.

**Aren't there laws regulating the use of animals in
laboratories?**

In the United States, the Animal Welfare Act regulates the use
of laboratory animals, though it is often not enforced. Also,
there is a loophole in this law, due to the fact that the U.S.
federal government does not classify mice, rats, and birds as
animals.

As a result, the Animal Welfare Act does not apply to mice,
rats, and birds, and there are no federal restrictions on what
can be done to these animals in research labs.

It should be mentioned that the Animal Welfare Act **also
does not apply** to farmed animals which are raised for
food.

## How is experimenting on animals any different from other situations where humans kill animals for survival?

**Original URL:** https://veg1.org/experimenting_survival.html


**How is experimenting on animals any different from
other situations where humans kill animals for survival?**

Aside from the fact that there are often [alternative methods](medical_alternatives.html) for
doing medical research, the concern regarding experimentation is
not just that animals are killed in the process. The greater
concern is the suffering involved, which is often a fate
considerably worse than death. This is the reason why even people
who support the death penalty would consider it appalling to
perform such experiments on convicted felons awaiting execution.

## What if the cure to cancer could be produced by a hypothetical experiment on just a single animal?

**Original URL:** https://veg1.org/single_experiment.html


**What if the cure to cancer could be produced by a
hypothetical experiment on just a single animal?**

Under these hypothetical conditions, many animal rights
supporters would allow the experiment. Of course, these
conditions are completely unrealistic, and would never be met in
real life. Nevertheless, I believe that discussing such
hypothetical scenarios sheds considerable insight into the issues
involved.

Let us consider a new hypothetical scenario which is slightly
different. Again, suppose that the cure to cancer could be
produced by a hypothetical experiment on just a single test
subject. However, in this new scenario, **suppose
that the test subject must be a human being**.

We can try to escape the ethical dilemma by volunteering
ourselves as the test subject. However, let us hypothetically
suppose that the test subject must meet certain physical
criteria, and that neither we nor any other volunteers meet this
criteria. Therefore, if we are to perform this single experiment
and cure cancer, we must select an innocent human being against
his will.

Let us also hypothetically suppose that we have found a
potential test subject without any friends or relatives.
Furthermore, suppose that he is severely mentally retarded, and
that his potential for intelligence is no greater than that of a
typical laboratory rat. Do we believe that performing this
experiment is ethically acceptable?

Some people would say that it is never permissible to take an
innocent human life under any conditions, and would find the
entire suggestion abhorrent. Others would point out that we kill
innocent people when we bomb enemy countries in times of war, and
that we do this for reasons considerably less noble than finding
the cure to cancer.

Many others would respond that while they are not pacifists,
there are significant moral distinctions between killing people
in times of war and performing an experiment on a human being
against his will. Others would respond that we should at least
consider performing the experiment depending on how much
suffering the person will have to endure before he dies.

Regardless of how we answer, we should at least be logically
consistent in the application of our ethical principles. That is,
our answer should not change depending on if the potential test
subject is of the same race or ethnicity as we are. Nor should
our answer change based on the potential test subject's gender or
nationality.

Although this is a view which is not shared by all animal
rights supporters, I believe that our answer should also not
change depending on whether or not the potential test subject is
of the same species as us. I believe that the species boundary is
no less arbitrary than boundaries such as race, ethnicity, and
nationality.

Not all animal rights supporters agree with me, but I believe
that the only way we can be logically consistent in condoning an
experiment on an animal is if we would also condone performing
the exact same experiment on a member of our own species.

## Isn't it insulting to compare human beings with animals?

**Original URL:** https://veg1.org/humans_are_animals.html


**Isn't it insulting and inaccurate to compare human
beings with animals?**  

  

  

Human beings are animals. 98.6% of our genetic code is identical
to that of a chimpanzee. Chimpanzees are genetically closer to
human beings than they are to gorillas. In fact, chimpanzees are
even genetically closer to humans than rats are to mice.

<a id="language"></a>

## Don't only humans have the ability to use language and understand abstract concepts?

**Original URL:** https://veg1.org/language.html


**Don't only humans have the ability to use language
and understand abstract concepts?**  

  

  

Even [insects](insects.html) possess language, since
they communicate with each other using chemicals and body
language. All animals have a language, even though they do not
speak with a human voice.

However, even the ability to speak with a human voice is not
unique to humans. There is an African gray parrot named Alex who
has learned human speech, and can consistently give correct
answers to questions he has never previously been asked, about
objects which he has never previously seen. This parrot thereby
demonstrates that he is not simply memorizing the answers, but is
engaging in analytical reasoning, and demonstrating comprehension
of abstract concepts such as shapes and numbers.

The language of many species is far more complex than we
previously realized. For example, prairie dogs make various calls
to each other which sound identical to the human ear. It is only
when these calls were recorded, and analyzed on a sound
spectrograph, that we learned that the prairie dog vocabulary was
much larger than we had ever imagined. For example, although they
all sound identical to the human ear, prairie dogs have different
calls for warning each other about the approach of a human male
and a human female. The calls are also different depending on
what color clothing the person is wearing. And, they have
different calls depending on whether or not the human is carrying
a gun.

In the past, people have complained about racial bias in the
construction of intelligence tests. We are now dealing with
something even harder to eliminate in our intelligence tests -
species bias. As one of the more obvious examples, we often judge
the intelligence of animals such as dolphins based on how many
human words they can learn and understand. However, dolphins have
a very complex language which we have, so far, been completely
unable to decipher. If dolphins were to apply this same test to
humans, then the dolphins would have to conclude that humans are
complete idiots, since despite our best efforts, we have failed
to learn even a single word that the dolphins are saying.

<a id="self_aware"></a>

## Aren't only humans self aware?

**Original URL:** https://veg1.org/self_aware.html


**Aren't only humans self aware?**  

  

  

Other animals recognize both themselves and others as
individuals. Animals clearly remember both their own and everyone
else's place in the social hierarchy. They use [language to express abstract concepts](language.html).
They remember which individuals in their community are their [friends](social_contracts.html). They pass on [cultural information](animal_culture.html) from one
generation to the next. And they [mourn
their dead](concept_of_death.html).

In spite of all this, the evidence which finally convinces
most skeptics is the mirror experiment. This test involves
placing a mirror in front of an animal, and checking if the
animal realizes they are looking at a reflection of themselves. Various
animals, such as dolphins, chimpanzees, some birds and fish, and certain [ants](ants.html) pass the
mirror test. Some of these animals go to great lengths to maneuver in front of the
mirror so as to closely examine parts of their bodies which they
normally can not see.

It should be pointed out that although passing the mirror test
indicates self awareness, failing the mirror test does not
indicate a lack of self awareness. For example, there were
several cases where I passed in front of a wall sized mirror, and
did not recognize my own reflection for the first minute or two.
I initially just thought that it was an interesting coincidence
that someone else was wearing the same clothes as me.
Nevertheless, this does not imply that I lacked self awareness
during these few minutes. It is possible for some animals to lack
the insight to ever be able to pass the mirror test, and yet be
completely self aware. This is especially true of animals such as dogs, 
which fail to recognize their own reflection, but succeed in recognizing their own odor.
Humans are unable to recognize their own odor, but this should not cause dogs to conclude that humans lack self awareness.

There are still some people who feel uncomfortable accepting
self awareness in other animals. This should not be surprising
when considered in historical context. During the 18th century, many European philosophers believed that black people did not possess self awareness.

Their argument was that only beings with a soul can possess self awareness. Furthermore, they argued that the test for if someone possesses a soul is whether or not they have the capacity for rational thought. They also argued that the test for the capacity for rational thought is whether or not an individual had the potential to understand a written language. The widely accepted belief at the time was that black people did not have the mental capacity to learn to read or write. Although some black people had been writing in Arabic centuries earlier, this fact was unknown to these European philosophers. Therefore, many European philosophers concluded that black people did not possess a soul, were not the descendants of Adam and Eve, and did not have the capacity for self-awareness.

It is difficult for us today to imagine how otherwise
intelligent people can actually hold such views, yet this was
once a dominant belief of educated people. Future generations may
react in similar revulsion when learning about the way in which
our present society views the mental abilities of animals.

<a id="macaques"></a>

## What evidence is there that other animals can make moral decisions?

**Original URL:** https://veg1.org/macaques.html


**What evidence is there that other animals can make
moral decisions?**   

  

  

There is evidence that humans are not the only animals capable of
making moral decisions. As one example, below is a passage from
the book S*hadows of Forgotten Ancestors*, written by Drs.
Sagan and Druyan, about an experiment performed on macaque
monkeys.

**"In the annals of primate
ethics, there are some accounts that have the ring of parable. In
a laboratory setting, macaques were fed if they were willing to
pull a chain and electrically shock an unrelated macaque whose
agony was in plain view through a one-way mirror. Otherwise, they
starved. After learning the ropes, the monkeys frequently refused
to pull the chain; in one experiment only 13% would do so - 87%
preferred to go hungry. One macaque went without food for nearly
two weeks rather than hurt its fellow. Macaques who had
themselves been shocked in previous experiments were even less
willing to pull the chain. The relative social status or gender
of the macaques had little bearing on their reluctance to hurt
others.**

**"If asked to choose between
the human experimenters offering the macaques this Faustian
bargain and the macaques themselves - suffering from real hunger
rather than causing pain to others-our own moral sympathies do
not lie with the scientists. But their experiments permit us to
glimpse in non-humans a saintly willingness to make sacrifices in
order to save others - even those who are not close kin.  By
conventional human standards, these macaques - who have never
gone to Sunday school, never heard of the Ten Commandments, never
squirmed through a single junior high school civics lesson - seem
exemplary in their moral grounding and their courageous
resistance to evil. Among these macaques, at least in this case,
heroism is the norm.**

**"If the circumstances were
reversed, and captive humans were offered the same deal by
macaque scientists, would we do as well? (Especially when there
is an authority figure urging us to administer the electric
shocks, we humans are disturbingly willing to cause pain - and
for a reward much more paltry than food is for a starving macaque
[cf. Stanley Milgram, Obedience to Authority: An Experimental
Overview].) In human history there are a precious few whose
memory we revere because they knowingly sacrificed themselves for
others. For each of them, there are multitudes who did
nothing."**

Discussing the macaque monkeys who chose to starve rather than
inflict pain on another, Drs. Sagan and Druyan conclude,
"Might we have a more optimistic view of the human future if
we were sure our ethics were up to their standards?"

To this, I would like to add that as we sit back and wonder
how we ourselves would behave if we were placed in the situation
which the macaques found themselves in, we should realize that
this scenario is not a hypothetical one for us. Every time we
make a decision of whether or not to eat meat, we are making a
decision of whether or not to inflict suffering on others for a
reward much smaller than food is for a starving monkey.

Unlike the macaques, we have the ability to alleviate our
hunger without pulling the chain. This is by eating a vegan diet, which actually happens to be much healthier for us. Therefore, every time we
make a decision to eat meat, we are making a decision of whether
or not to inflict death and suffering on others simply for the
pleasure of tasting meat - and there are very few forms of
suffering in this world which can rival that which is inflicted
on modern factory farms.

However, unlike the macaques, we are not forced to witness the
agony of our victims through a one way mirror.

## Don't only humans have the ability to pass on cultural information from one generation to the next?

**Original URL:** https://veg1.org/animal_culture.html


**Don't only humans have the ability to pass on
cultural information from one generation to the next?**  

  

  

Even animals like rats can pass cultural information from one
generation to the next. We know this not because we were
necessarily trying to study rat intelligence, but because rats
have long been out smarting the humans who have been trying to
poison and kill them.

This is illustrated by the following experiment which was
designed to study how to poison rats more successfully. A colony
of rats in a controlled environment was fed two types of food.
Let us call these food X and food Y. Initially, the rats ate both
types of food in equal amounts. One day, food X was poisoned with
lithium chloride. Although neither food was ever poisoned after
this one day, no rat in the colony ever ate food X again. What is
especially interesting about this, though, is that no rat in the
colony ever ate food X again even many generations later.

This colony of rats effectively had a cultural taboo which it
was passing down from one generation to the next. This taboo made
this colony of rats culturally distinct from other rat colonies
of the same species. Just as with human taboos, this taboo
persisted long after the reason for the taboo no longer existed.
But it still made sense for this taboo to be maintained. After
all, would you want to be the first rat to try food X again to
see if it was poisoned, after no one had been eating it for many
generations?

There is considerable evidence of far more complex cultural
traditions in animals, particularly with regards to [tool use](animal_tools.html) among primates. However, I
wanted to use rats in my example to emphasize that it is not just
primates which pass cultural traditions to future generations.

<a id="concept_of_death"></a>

## Don't only humans understand the concept of death?

**Original URL:** https://veg1.org/concept_of_death.html


**Don't only humans understand the concept of death?**  

  

  

We have direct evidence that other animals do understand the
concept of death. For example, when elephants pass the skeletal
remains of old friends during their migration, they stop and seem
to mourn. We can not be certain what these elephants are
thinking, due to the fact that we do not yet know how to
communicate with them.

However, we can communicate with animals such as chimpanzees
through sign language. There was a case where a chimpanzee infant
died during surgery, and it was the duty of the trainer to tell
the chimp's mother, in sign language, that her baby had died.
According to the trainer, it was clear that the chimpanzee mother
understood, and that she reacted in the same manner that any
human mother would.

<a id="social_contracts"></a>

## Don't only humans have the ability to enter social contracts?

**Original URL:** https://veg1.org/social_contracts.html


**Don't only humans have the ability to enter social
contracts?**  

  

  

Other animals do agree to certain types of social contracts with
each other. For example, some species of bats share the food they
find with others in their community who they are not related to.
It is not possible to force a bat to share against his will,
since this process is done by regurgitating food directly into
the mount of the recipient. Each bat remembers which individuals
in the community have helped them when they themselves were
hungry, and they remember which individuals refused to help them
in their time of need, and these bats respond in kind.

It is not unusual for a bat to be unable to find food for
several days, in which case his survival depends on having
friends. In effect, by sharing food with others, these bats are
purchasing an insurance policy. A bat with a large network of
friends is much more likely to survive - and a bat who chooses
not to honor his contracts (not help those who have helped him in
the past) will soon find himself without any friends when he is
in need of assistance.

## Don't only humans have the ability to use tools?

**Original URL:** https://veg1.org/animal_tools.html


**Don't only humans have the ability to use tools?**  

  

  

Humans are not the only animals who know how to use tools.

As one example, some tribes of chimpanzees use rocks to crack
open nuts. Knowledge of how to do this is passed on from one
generation to the next, as the young watch their elders.

This procedure requires using two rocks, one as an anvil, and
one as a hammer. The process of selecting the right type of rock
for the anvil and the right type of rock for the hammer, and the
process of smashing a nut between them is one which is very
tricky, and requires considerable practice. This was apparent
when a human researcher studying the chimps tried to do this
himself. It took him several hours to crack open his first nut, a
process which takes experienced chimps only a few seconds.

Other tribes of chimpanzees of the same species have not
discovered this cultural knowledge. The shells of these nuts are
too hard too be opened with their teeth, and these other tribes
therefore do not have these nuts as a part of their diet, even
though both rocks and nuts are plentiful. As different tribes of
chimpanzees interact, knowledge of varies types of tool use, such
as this one, is transmitted from one tribe to another.

I find it particularly interesting to compare how new
practices are spread in human and other primate societies. For
example, there was a case where a young female macaque monkey
discovered how to remove the sand off of fruit by washing the
fruit in the river. The first monkeys in the community to copy
the procedure were her mother and the other children. Later, the
other adult females also began to wash their fruit. The absolute
last group in the society to adopt the practice was the adult
males, and I can not help but wonder if there are any parallels
to human societies.

## Don't humans have bigger brains than all other animals?

**Original URL:** https://veg1.org/brain_size.html


**Don't humans have bigger brains than all other
animals?**   

  

  

No. The brains of animals such as elephants and blue whales are
considerably larger than the brains of humans.

Most people therefore acknowledge that intelligence is not
necessarily proportional to brain mass.

Nevertheless, many people will instead try to argue that
intelligence is proportional to the ratio of brain mass to body
mass, and will point out that humans have a much higher ratio of
brain mass to body mass than do elephants or whales. However, the
problem with this argument is that animals such as the pygmy
shrew have a ratio of brain mass to body mass which is roughly
equal to that of humans.

## What is meant by the term "rights" ?

**Original URL:** https://veg1.org/what_are_rights.html


**What is meant by the term *Rights*?**  

  

  

Many people in the world live under governments where they have
virtually no legal rights. Nevertheless, we generally believe
that these people still have basic "human rights", even
though these rights are routinely denied to them. In this sense,
when we refer to a person's "rights", we are not
referring to their legal rights. Instead, we are referring to the
moral obligations which every government and individual has
towards this person, regardless of whether or not these
obligations are being fulfilled.

It is in this same sense that people discuss animal rights. In
addition to this, the term "animal rights" has come to
signify the view that our moral obligation to animals goes far
beyond that which is acknowledged by traditional humane
societies. Traditional humane societies condemn the forms of
cruelty which are already considered to be socially unacceptable,
such as setting a cat on fire. Supporters of animal rights go
beyond this by also condemning practices which currently remain
legal - such as testing cosmetics on animals, killing animals for
their fur, and slaughtering animals for food.

## Where do rights come from?

**Original URL:** https://veg1.org/where_rights_come_from.html


**Where do rights come from?**  

  

  

There are many different views about the nature and origin of
morality. Animal rights activists have varying opinions about the
answer to this question, just as the rest of the public has
varying opinions about the answer to this question.

Some animal rights activists believe that all our ethical
guidelines are the creation of human societies, and believe that
animals should be included in our human made ethical codes. Other
animal rights activists believe that our moral laws come from
God, and believe that it is God's will for humans to include
animals in our sphere of compassion. Other animal rights
supporters have many other views.

My personal view is that objective moral laws come from the same place
that the law of gravity comes from. I explain my reasoning for
this view in [my other web
page](morals.html), which deals with morality in general. I need to
emphasize that the views I express there are **my own
personal opinions**, and do not necessarily reflect the
views of other animal rights supporters.

## Why should we behave better towards animals than they do towards each other?

**Original URL:** https://veg1.org/better_than_animals_behave.html


**Why should we behave better towards animals than
they do towards each other?**  

  

  

We have a duty to act morally towards others regardless of how
anyone else behaves. For example, the institution of slavery in
the United States was not in any way justified by the fact that

## Why do we have a moral obligation to animals who do not understand moral concepts?

**Original URL:** https://veg1.org/moral_agents.html


**Why do we have a moral obligation to animals who
do not understand moral concepts?**

There are many human beings who do not have the ability to
understand moral concepts. Examples are infants, the severely
mentally retarded, and elderly people who's minds have
deteriorated.

Nevertheless, we believe that we have an obligation to act
morally towards these individuals, even though they themselves do
not have the ability to make ethical decisions.

Incidentally, it is worth pointing out that human beings are
not the only animals capable of understanding moral concepts.

## What do we gain by respecting the rights of other animals if they do not respect our rights?

**Original URL:** https://veg1.org/gain.html


**What do we gain by respecting the rights of other
animals if they do not respect our rights?**  

  

  

There are some wild animals who respect the rights of humans.
For centuries, dolphins have been known to help drowning sailors swim to shore. There
are also countless examples of domesticated animals, such as
dogs, who risk their lives to save their adopted human family,
even though they were never trained or instructed to do so.
However, it is true that for the most part, these are the
exceptions rather than the rule.

From purely the perspective of self interest, in many cases we have
nothing at all to gain by respecting the rights of animals. Most
animals are simply not capable of returning the favor.

However, morality is not about trying to figure out how to
maximize our own selfish interests. True morality is not
displayed by a shrewd politician who acts benevolently only
because the TV cameras are watching. Nor is it displayed by
someone who is kind to others only because he expects a favor in
return. Nor is it displayed by someone who behaves a certain way
only to avoid punishment in an afterlife.

In my opinion, true morality is about acting in the interest
of others, even when we have nothing to gain in return.

## What if humans treat and slaughter the animals humanely?

**Original URL:** https://veg1.org/humane_slaughter.html


**What if humans treat and slaughter the
animals humanely?**  

  

  

Regardless of how well the animals are treated, I believe that it
is wrong, even in principle, to kill animals for food when it is
not necessary for our survival.

I personally had a very large number of family members who died in the Holocaust.
One of the reasons concentration camps were invented was to make the killing process more humane, as opposed to firing squads.
In the case of firing squads, the bullets did not necessarily make an instant kill and many people died slowly and painfully, as bodies were piled on top of each other, some living and some dead.
By contrast the poison gas of a concentration camp, by comparison, killed people much more quickly and painlessly.
Nevertheless, we are still not going to give the "Humanitarian of the Year" award to the person that invented concentration camps.

There is no such thing as a humane concentration camp and there is absolutely no such thing as a humane slaughter house.

## What about eating road kill?

**Original URL:** https://veg1.org/road_kill.html


**What about eating road kill?**

The reason I am vegan is because I do not wish to
contribute to the death or suffering of animals. Therefore, I
have no ethical objections to eating an animal who was
accidentally killed by a car, provided that this will not
encourage anyone to kill more animals in the future.

However, although I have no ethical objections to it, I choose
not to eat road kill for a variety of other reasons. This is the
same way in which I have no ethical objections to eating rat
droppings, since this would not harm the rats in any way, but I
still prefer not to eat rat droppings for a variety of other
reasons.

## Aren't animals also killed during the harvesting of crops and the construction of roads?

**Original URL:** https://veg1.org/harvesting_crops.html


**Aren't animals also killed during the harvesting
of crops and the construction of roads?**  

  

  

Yes. I make no claims of ethical purity. I am fully aware that
rats, snakes, and various other animals are killed during the
harvesting of plants for my vegan diet. I am also aware that I am
contributing to the degradation of the environment every time I
drive my car. Being vegan is not about a quest for
personal purity, which is an unachievable goal. It is about doing
what we can not to needlessly contribute to the death and suffering of animals.

When our society takes the concept of animal rights seriously,
we will have to reform the way in which we harvest crops and
construct roads so as to try to reduce the number of animals
killed. However, this is not going to occur as long as our
society continues to view animals as just a food source. I
realize that, in some way, I am contributing to the death of
animals simply by interacting with society. However, I believe
that withdrawing from society would cause even greater harm,
because I would lose the ability to influence and encourage
others to move towards a vegan lifestyle.

Although animals are killed during the cultivation of crops
for vegan diets, it should be pointed out that far
more animals are killed during the cultivation of crops for a
meat based diet. This is because plants have to be fed to the
livestock, and only a small fraction of the food which an animal
eats is converted into meat for human consumption. Far fewer
animals would be killed during the cultivation of crops if humans
ate these crops directly, instead of feeding to these crops to
livestock.

Ultimately, regardless of how hard we try to avoid it, some
animals are always going to be accidentally killed in the course
of human events. This is the same way in which, regardless of how
hard we try, some people will always die in car accidents.
However, the fact that we might accidentally run someone over
with our car does not imply that it is ok to run them over on
purpose.

<a id="need_meat"></a>

## What about situations where humans need to eat meat to survive?

**Original URL:** https://veg1.org/need_meat.html


**What about situations where humans need to eat
meat to survive?**

This situation exists for a few cultures which have virtually
no contact with the industrialized world, and which live in
geographic areas where the native vegetation does not permit a
vegetarian diet.

I believe that the reason that it is not wrong for animals
such as lions to eat meat is because two conditions are both
simultaneously met. These conditions are that lions genuinely
need to eat meat to survive, and that the ecological balance of
the area depends on lions hunting their prey.

If both of these conditions are met for humans, as they are in
a few existing non-industrialized cultures, then I believe that
these humans are as ethically justified in hunting animals as are
lions. So I do believe that eating meat is ethically permissible
in certain hypothetical situations.

I also believe that cannibalism is ethically permissible in
certain hypothetical situations. For example, suppose a group of
people are stranded on a desert island, and they will all die of
starvation prior to being rescued unless they cannibalize each
other. In this hypothetical scenario, I believe that cannibalism
is ethically permissible.

However, the fact that eating meat may be ethically
permissible in certain hypothetical scenarios should not be an
excuse for us to engage in it when the conditions of these
scenarios clearly do not apply to us.

Although the following is probably obvious, I feel I should
emphasize that my answer to this question is my own personal
opinion (as are my answers to most other questions) and does not
necessarily represent the views of other animal rights
supporters.

## If we didn't raise animals for food, then they would never have had the chance to be born and experience life at all

**Original URL:** https://veg1.org/chance_to_live.html


**If we didn't raise animals for food, then they
would never have had the chance to be born and experience life at
all.**

Considering how the vast majority of farm animals are
currently raised in modern industrialized agriculture, these
animals would have been far better off never having been born.
The best moment in these animals lives is when they finally die,
because only then does their suffering finally end.

However, if the animals are raised and slaughtered humanely,
some would say that it is better for the animals to have
experienced life for a brief time before slaughter, rather than
never have been born at all. My response to this is the
following.

Once an individual is born, we have the same obligation to act
ethically toward them as we do towards everyone else. This is not
changed by the fact that the individual would have never been
born in the first place without our intervention. This is the
reason that child abuse is immoral. Even though the child would
have never existed without his parents, this does not give his
parents the right to physically abuse him.

If we hypothetically lived in a cannibalistic society which
bred and raised a race of humans for food, then we would be
correct in condemning this practice, even though without it,
these humans would have never existed in the first place.

In spite of all this reasoning, some people insist that by
refraining from eating meat, I am guilty of depriving farm
animals the chance to be born and experience life. One way to
respond to this is to point out the inherent inefficiency of
using farm land to grow crops for livestock, instead of growing
crops consumed directly by humans. If everyone ate a vegan
diet, then a much larger human population could be sustained with
the available resources.

Therefore, if I am "guilty" of depriving farm
animals the chance to be born, then people who eat meat are
"guilty" of depriving human beings the chance to be
born and experience life.

## Why are "Free Range" farms not much better?

**Original URL:** https://veg1.org/vegan.html


In the United States, even products labeled "organic" and "free range" typically come from farms where animals are treated almost as badly as what is shown in the video, and they go to the exact same slaughterhouse as all the other animals. These labels are typically just a marketing gimmick to fool people into thinking that the animals were treated well.

The only thing the term "free range" means is that the animals have some access to the outdoors. As a result, free-range conditions typically amount to 20,000 birds crowded inside an enclosed shed containing a single exit leading to a small outdoor area, which only a tiny fraction of the birds can access at any given time, and which most of them will never realistically be able to make it to. Therefore, "free range" animals typically still go through debeaking, dehorning, tail docking, castration, etc. And they are still crowded together, and they still go to the exact same slaughterhouse as non-free range animals. And the only thing "organic" means is that the animals are not given hormones or antibiotics. Everything else is typically the same as the video.

Also, there are many "free range" and "organic" companies that claim that they treat their animals extremely well, but then when undercover videos are taken, it is shown just how horrible the conditions really are. For example, the male chicks are still thrown into a grinder, even at the "cage-free" egg farms which claim to care about animals. For most people in the United States, trying to find meat, eggs, or dairy from a place that does not treat their animals this way would require far more effort than going vegan.

In any case, no animal wants to go to the slaughterhouse.

## Why is eating meat wrong?

**Original URL:** https://veg1.org/cat_analogy.html


**Why is it wrong to eat meat?**

Regardless of what we think about the more controversial aspects
of animal rights, such as medical experimentation, there is a
general consensus in our society that it is ethically
reprehensible to set a cat on fire for entertainment. However,
since we do not need to eat meat to survive, when we choose to
eat meat, we are choosing to inflict death and suffering on
others simply for the pleasure of tasting meat. 
What goes on in factory farms and slaughterhouses causes at least as much suffering to animals as does setting a cat on fire for entertainment.
In both cases, all that we gain in return is just a few moments of trivial pleasure.

Fish feel pain and suffering just as all other animals do, and just as we humans do. Also, since fish are smaller than other animals, many more die per meal. In addition, over fishing is destroying the ocean ecosystems, and driving many aquatic species towards extinction.

## Why is it wrong to eat dairy and eggs?

**Original URL:** https://veg1.org/Eggs_and_Dairy.html


**Why is it wrong to eat dairy and eggs?**  

  

  

For a cow to give milk, she must first give birth. Therefore, the cows are impregnated, and the calves are taken away from their mothers immediately after birth, so that all the milk will be consumed by humans. The male calves are either slaughtered immediately, or raised as veal. When the milk production declines, the cow is reimpregnated, and the process repeats itself. When the cow is around six years old, her milk production permanently declines, and she is sent to the slaughterhouse, even though the normal lifespan for cows is much longer.

With regards to eggs, most male chicks are killed at birth, both for caged and for cage-free eggs. Also, even the cage-free operations still crowd the hens together, cut off a portion of the birds beaks, and kill the hens when their egg production declines. 
Egg laying hens are by far the worst treated of all farm animals, far more so than the animals raised for meat.

## Meat tastes too good to become a vegan.

**Original URL:** https://veg1.org/meat_tastes_good.html


**Meat tastes too good to become a vegan.**  

  

  

Many people who are now vegans once thought the same thing.
However, they decided that an action does not become morally
justified simply because they enjoy doing it, and that the inconvenience of a
transition to a new lifestyle is relatively minor compared to
the amount of animal death and suffering for which they would otherwise continue to be responsible.

For people who want to become vegans without having to
give up the taste of meat, there are products such as
veggie-burgers, veggie-sausages, and veggie-bacon. These products
look and (depending on the brand) taste like meat, but are made
entirely out of plant based ingredients.

**If everyone becomes a vegan, then what will
we do with all the farm animals?**  

  

  

Farm animals exist in such large numbers only because human
beings breed them for slaughter, often through artificial
insemination. As more people become vegan, fewer farm
animals will be bred, and their population will be reduced.

If everyone eventually becomes a vegan, then the number
of farm animals which will exist will only be a tiny fraction of
the number today.

**Original URL:** https://veg1.org/already_dead.html


**Aren't the animals already dead when we purchase
meat in a grocery store?**  

  

  

Yes, the animals are already dead when we purchase meat in a
grocery store. However, this is only because we are, in effect,
hiring someone to kill them for us.

The number of animals which are bred and slaughtered depends
directly on the consumer demand for animal products. Every time we refrain
from purchasing animal products, we reduce this consumer
demand, and ensure that fewer animals will be bred and forced to
suffer.

So, although the animals we are eating are already dead when
we purchase meat in a grocery store, doing so directly increases
the number of animals which will have to suffer and die in the
future.

Yes, if everyone becomes a vegan, then many people who

a living.

Several hundred years ago, many people's jobs and economic
well being depended on the continuation of the slave trade.
Nevertheless, the ethics of the situation dictated that the slave
trade should be abolished, even though this meant that these
people would have to find a new way to earn a living.

There is nothing new or unusual about the process of an entire

invented.

## Don't the majority of people think there is nothing morally wrong with eating meat?

**Don't the majority of people think there is
nothing morally wrong with eating meat?**

This is correct. However, as discussed in the [title page](Animal_Rights.html),
truth is not democratic.  The Earth does not become flat
just because the majority of the population thinks that it
is.

One hundred years ago, racial segregation was considered acceptable
by the majority of the United States. Two hundred years ago,
slavery was considered morally acceptable by the vast majority of
the world. Two thousand years ago, it was considered acceptable to feed innocent people to lions for public
entertainment. If you look further back, it was considered
acceptable in some parts of the world to have servants buried
alive with their recently deceased master.

In each case, morality progressed because a small number of
people looked at the ethics of their society, and concluded that
it needed to be improved. Now is no better a time to think that
we have it all figured out than were any of these other points in
history.

## Isn't eating meat a part of our cultural heritage?

**Original URL:** https://veg1.org/cultural_heritage.html


**Isn't eating meat a part of our cultural heritage?**  

  

  

Yes it is. To take the United States as an example, eating turkey
is a traditional part of celebrating Thanksgiving, and many
American cultural heroes were hunters. Other cultures have
similar examples.

However, not everything in our cultural heritage is something
to be proud of. To take the United States as an example once
again, George Washington and many of the founding fathers owned
slaves. The slave trade, the slaughter of the Native Americans,
and the internment camps for Japanese Americans during WWII, and
the McCarthyism during the Cold War are all parts of the American
cultural heritage and legacy.

In my opinion, one of the strengths of American culture is
that we readily admit to mistakes which were made in the past. In
our schools, we teach the darkest episodes of our history to our
children, without any defensiveness or hesitation. This stands in
sharp contrast to many other cultures around the world.

When future generations look back at our time period, the fact
that we once ate meat will simply be one of the many aspects of
our cultural heritage which we are not proud of. And in
particular, the way in which the United States currently raises animals for food will not
just be viewed as one of the darkest chapters of American
history, but it will be viewed as one of the darkest chapters in
world history.

## Haven't humans eaten meat ever since they walked the Earth?

**Haven't humans eaten meat ever since they walked
the Earth?**

Yes. However, as discussed in the [title page](Animal_Rights.html), an activity does not become
morally justified simply because it has been going on for a long
period of time.  Slavery, genocide, rape, and torture are
all activities which have been going on since long before the
dawn of recorded human history.

Furthermore, it is interesting to note that although humans
have eaten meat throughout their history, it was a relatively
small portion of our diets up until the twentieth century. A
vegetarian diet actually bears closer resemblance to what humans
have eaten throughout most of our history than does a typical
American diet.

**Do you want to make eating meat illegal?**  

  

  

I believe in democracy, and I have no desire to impose my beliefs
on others as a dictator. However, I do hope that the majority of
the population will eventually conclude that it is wrong to
inflict death and suffering on animals simply for the pleasure of
tasting meat. When this day comes, I hope that the practice will
be outlawed through the democratic process.

This is a view which is not shared by all animal rights
activists. Many insist that it is wrong to impose our morality on
others, even if it is done through the democratic process.
However, I would point out that when we outlaw murder, rape, and
torture, we are effectively "forcing our morality" on
those who see nothing ethically wrong with murder, rape or
torture.

Furthermore, I would point out that every time
we choose to eat meat, we are "forcing our morality" on
the animals which we send to the slaughter house.

before worrying about animals?**  

  

  

I personally had a very large number of family members who died in the Holocaust. 
If there is something more important than ending a Holocaust, please let me know what it is, and I will go and do it.

There are indeed many dire human problems which need immediate
attention. However, going vegan does not in any way
take away from our ability to address these problems. On the
contrary, since a vegetarian diet is less expensive than one
which includes meat, this leaves people with more money to spend
on the issues which they believe are the most important.

Also, going vegan directly helps reduce world
hunger. Only a small fraction of the food which is consumed by an
animal is converted into meat for human consumption. If the land
which grows food for livestock was instead used to grow crops
consumed directly by humans, then far more food would be
available for the world's poor.

Aside from the issue of veganism, there is also the issue
of the money people spend on animals. I believe that it is indeed
appropriate to criticize the way in which the citizens of
affluent countries choose to spend their money. However,
criticism of money spent on the alleviation of animal suffering
is not what should be coming to mind.

People routinely spend money on items such as expensive cars
and jewelry, when this money can instead be given to
organizations such as [UNICEF (United Nations Children's Fund)](http://www.unicef.org/).
Instead of criticizing money spent on animals, we should try to
remember our concern for global human poverty when deciding if to
purchase a new TV or go on an expensive vacation.

## How can some animal rights activists believe that other animals are our equals?

**Original URL:** https://veg1.org/animal_equality.html


**How can some animal rights activists believe that
other animals are our equals?**  

  

Before answering this, I need to first emphasize that this
is a view which is not shared by many animal rights activists.
For example, there are some animal rights activists who hold the
view that only human beings are [made
in the image of God](animal_soul.html).

However, I myself do believe that other animals are our equals
in some sense, and I would like to explain the reasoning behind
this.

We often like to say that all human beings are created equal,
and this is a statement I strongly agree with. However, we need
to stop and ask ourselves what we mean by the phrase "all
human beings are created equal." Do we mean that all human
beings have equal intelligence, equal creativity, and equal
physical abilities? If this is what we mean, then we are clearly
in trouble, since we are not all equal in these regards. For
example, a severely mentally retarded human clearly has less
intelligence than you or I do.

However, I still believe that it is accurate to say that all
human beings are created equal in the sense that all human beings
deserve equal compassion, and equal ethical consideration, in
spite of their inequalities in these other areas. If we extend
this type of "equality" to severely mentally retarded
humans, then we must also extend it to other species. This is
because the animals which we kill for food, clothing, and
experimentation have a considerably higher level of intelligence,
and capacity for social interaction, than do many severally
mentally retarded humans who we correctly recognize as our
equals.

Most importantly, other animals feel pain and suffering just
as we do, and they value their lives just as we value ours.

## Isn't it wrong for vegans to act as if they are better than others and try to convert people?

**Isn't it wrong for vegans to act as if they
are better than others and try to convert people?**  

  

  

There are many factors that determine a person's moral character, such as how
much they give to charity, their honesty, and how they treat the people
they interact with. There are, no doubt, some vegans who
exhibit a considerably worse overall moral character than do meat
eaters. Nevertheless, considering the amount of death and suffering which we
directly cause when we choose to consume animal products, the decision to move towards a vegan lifestyle, in my opinion, is one of the most
important moral decisions we will ever make.

The reason I follow a vegan lifestyle is not to feel superior to
others, but to reduce animal death and suffering. To this end, my influence
on others is at least as important as the economic impact my
purchasing decisions make. I believe that it is important for all
of us (vegans included) to recognize the fact
that we ourselves are not ethically pure, and to not have a
condescending or "holier than thou" attitude.

We should all also try to not be offended when someone
politely suggests to us that a commonly accepted practice is
immoral. If everyone refrained from offering such criticism for
fear of offending someone, then institutions such as slavery
would have continued to exist down to today. Slave owners
certainly viewed themselves as good and moral people, and they
strongly resented any implications to the contrary.

This the same way in which some people today take offense at
the suggestion that eating meat is immoral, given what this
implies about the ethics of our lifestyles. It is only human
nature for some of us to react this way. However, I believe we
all need to try to not view criticisms of widely accepted
practices as personal attacks on ourselves, but instead
rationally evaluate these criticisms with an open mind, just as
we would have wanted earlier generations to rationally evaluate
criticisms of slavery and segregation.

Some animal rights activists are pro-choice. Others are pro-life. Opposing abortion does not require supporting cruelty towards animals.

## Doesn't duty to our own kind come first?

**Doesn't duty to our own kind come first?**  

  

  

It is unfortunate that it is a part of human nature to have less
compassion for those who are different from us than we do for our
own kind. The question people have often asked themselves is what
precisely is meant by the term "our own kind." Is it
those who are of the same nationality? Is it those who are of the
same race or religion? Is it those who are of the same tribe? Or
is it those who are of the same species?

In my opinion, the species boundary is no less arbitrary than
are any of these others. In fact, I would like to tell the story
of a holocaust survivor who immigrated to the United States, and
rented an apartment above a slaughter house. He said that what he
saw in that slaughter house every day was precisely the reason he
left Nazi Germany - indifference to the suffering of others
simply because they are believed to be different from us.

## Why children should rebel

**Original URL:** https://veg1.org/children.html

**Why Children Should
Rebel** 

#### written by Eugene Khutoryansky

 

Our current concept of childhood is a relatively recent
invention. Throughout most cultures throughout most of human
history, individuals today referred to as "children"
had the right to marry, serve in the army, and even act as the
head of state. 

We can still see remnants of this in ceremonies such as
Barmitzvah celebrations practiced by those who follow the Old
Testament, though the true purpose of such events has been
obscured by today's society. In the Judeo-Christian culture, boys
who reached the age of 13 were considered to be full fledged
adults, with all the associated rights and responsibilities. 

This is a far cry from today's attitudes and practices, where
even individuals considerably older than 13 are still not allowed
to own property in their own name, enter legal agreements, or
have any significant decision making power over how they are to
live their lives. Instead, they are entirely at the almost
arbitrary mercy of their parents or legal guardians. 

This situation is similar to the subordinate legal status
women had to their husbands just a few generations ago. It is in
effect a form of slavery, though under the supposed belief that
this is in the best interest of those who are enslaved. It was
only in 1920 that women finally gained the right to vote in the
United States. Prior to this date, it was considered outrageous
to propose that these "irrational creatures" could be
trusted to have a say in governance. 

In exactly the same way, most people currently assume that
children are not intellectually or emotionally competent to act
as our equals in society. This view is reflected in our language
when people tell each other to start "behaving like
adults." 

However, a few moments reflection should make us realize that
"typical adult behavior" consists of resolving our
disputes through military confrontations and through bitter
lawsuits. Nothing in our daily behavior is in any way superior to
the behavior of those we refer to as "children." 

The very definition of what it means to be an
"adult" has been warped by our society. When we refer
to an "adult horse" or an "adult dog", the
word "adult" refers to the reproductive maturity of
being able to produce offspring. By contrast, our society's legal
definition is based on an arbitrary age demarcation, long after
biological adulthood has already been attained. 

Neither biological adulthood nor legal adulthood are a
prerequisite for intellectual or emotional maturity. Nor are they
a guarantee of it. Some people are competent to make their own
decisions by the age of seven. Others are still not able to run
their own lives even by the age of thirty. 

Just as racism is unacceptable, it is also unacceptable to use
arbitrary age demarcation lines to determine who will have which
rights. 

Consider for example the right to drive a car. We obviously
need tests to determine who can be trusted with this
responsibility. However, to be fair, the same test must apply to
all people, regardless of race or gender, and regardless of
youth. If someone successfully passes the written exam and the
"behind the wheel" test, then there is no justification
to deny a driving license on the grounds that the applicant is
too young. 

The same principle can be applied to all other areas of life.
There is indeed a real need for limitations. For example, newborn
infants can not be trusted to make their own decisions. However,
the point in time at which people are given various rights and
responsibilities must be decided by fair and objective tests, not
by arbitrary age demarcation. 

If a five year old child born in the United States can pass
the same test immigrants take to attain citizenship, then this
child should be given the right to vote just as all other
Americans. If a six year old child can pass a test demonstrating
that he is aware of all the consequences of the issues involved,
then he should be allowed to determine who he will live with and
where he will go to school. If a seven year old child can pass a
test demonstrating that he has the intellectual fortitude to make
his own decisions in life, then he should be given the full right
to determine the course of his own destiny. 

Although no child should ever be forced to take these tests
against his will, these tests should always be made available to
any child who wishes to take them. 

Of course, there are many people who doubt that any child this
young can pass such tests. However, this is not the issue. Even
if we were to believe that no child will ever pass these tests,
we should not deny them the right to just "take the
test" simply because they are too young. 

If our skeptical predications are correct, and no child ever
passes these tests, then no harm has been done, since no child
will have attained these freedoms. If only one in a million
passes this test, then nothing will have changed for the over 99%
percent of the children who did not pass, but we should not
restrict the rights of this one child who did pass simply because
of the poor performance of his peers. 

 

There is a reason why we are reluctant to allow children to
demonstrate their competence through such tests. It is the fear
that they will outperform us. Many teenagers under the age of
sixteen would make better drivers than their parents, many young
children are far more aware of international politics than are
their parents, and quite frankly, there are many seven year olds
who would make much better decisions in life than many adults do.

There is unfortunately no shortage of examples of adults who
drown hopelessly in debt by living well beyond their means,
destroy their family lives with extramarital affairs, or throw
their careers away as the result of problems with alcohol. Yet
our society gives even these types of individuals full
sovereignty over the lives of their children, even when these
children would probably be much more capable at running the
family than their parents. 

In fact, children have an advantage over the rest of society
in many ways. They are far better at learning new skills and
better at analytical reasoning. They also tend to be far more
creative and open minded. These attributes tend to become far
less keen as people grow older. This can be seen in many daily
examples, such as the fact that parents often have to ask their
children for help when learning how to operate their computers. 

The sad thing about our current state of affairs is not just
that a large segment of our population has its rights and
freedoms systematically denied, but the fact that our society is
routinely denied the contributions of those citizens who
potentially have the most to contribute.

## What was your family history during the Holocaust?

**Original URL:** https://veg1.org/family_history.html

**What was your family history during the Holocaust?**  

  

  

I personally had a very large number of family members who died in the Holocaust.
I was born in the Soviet Union and my entire family is ethnically Jewish.
My grandmother came from a very large family with many cousins, aunts, and uncles.
Yet she is the only one who survived the war because she was away serving as a nurse in the Soviet Army when her hometown was occupied.

Her mother and sister were able to hide thanks to the help of the janitor of their apartment complex.
However, when one of their neighbors alerted the soldiers that there were Jews hiding in the janitor's supply room, they were killed by firing squad.
Also killed by firing squad was the janitor who had risked his life to do the right thing.

I was born long after the war was over.
But the city I was born in, Kiev, is the site of one of the largest massacres of the Second World War.
Kiev had a very large Jewish population, roughly similar to the Jewish population of Chicago.
When the Germans arrived, they had the Jews line up in front of the entire town and then they were marched off and killed by firing squad.

At least according to what my family tells me, the vast majority of the local population was very happy about what was happening.
Anti-semitism was very strong in this part of the world and
the Germans would have never been able to be successful with what they did if it had not been for the enthusiastic support and cooperation of the local population, 
because these were the people who were making sure that the Jews could not escape or run away.

The lesson to be learned from this, I believe, is that it is not just the people pulling the triggers who are responsible.

In the case of factory farms and slaughterhouses, the people in the videos are only doing what we are paying them to do on our behalf.
If we were not buying their products, none of this would be happening.
The number of animals which the industry breeds, tortures, and kills depends directly on consumer demand,
with every person's choices affecting hundreds of animals.

The people who chose to do the right thing in the 1940's were risking their lives, yet many did so anyway.
The people who choose to do the right thing today are only risking ridicule from their family and friends.

# Part 1

## Introduction

  

[Click Here to Go Back to the Index](morals.html) 

  

My purpose in writing this is to argue for the existence of an
objective morality based entirely on rational and scientific
reasoning. By "objective morality" I do not simply mean
that morality exists in the sense that various societies consider
various actions to be immoral. What I mean is that certain
actions are inherently right or wrong regardless of what any
society thinks about them. In other words, I mean that there is
an "objective morality" which exists independently of
human beliefs and human civilization. There are many people who
have the opinion that it is not possible to believe in such an
objective morality without also believing in concepts such as God
or an eternal soul. I believe that they are wrong. I will attempt
to show that an objective morality exists and that this morality
is the same regardless of which religion, if any, is correct. 

Many people believe that without a religious framework, the
only possible conclusion is that all morality is nothing more
than a human construct without any objective existence. In other
words, what morality a person or a culture accepts is like
picking a favorite flavor of ice cream. Some individuals prefer
strawberry ice cream, other individuals prefer chocolate, and no
person’s preference is "more correct" than
another’s. In a similar manner, they argue, different
individuals and different societies have various favorite moral
belief systems, and just as with ice cream, no particular set of
moral beliefs is "more correct" than any other. 

A common argument for this type of thinking is the following.
Throughout history, different cultures have had vastly different
moral systems. In fact, on almost any moral issue, it appears
that there is absolutely no agreement or consensus shared by even
a majority of the cultures throughout history. In addition to
this, there appears to be no way to prove the superiority of one
moral system over another using logic alone. So the only way in
which one moral system can actually be the correct one is if
religion is the tie breaker. That is, whichever value system the
"correct religion" advocates is the correct value
system. Otherwise, there is no way to decide between them. 

I believe that this type of argument is easily refuted. In
order to argue for the existence of an objective morality, I will
have to do more than just point out the flaws in lines of
reasoning such as this. I will have to provide my own arguments
that an objective morality does exist, and I will have to discuss
where this morality "comes from". I will also have to
explain a process by which we can attempt to determine what it
is. This is what I intend to do. I would first, though, like to
take some time to point out some of the errors in the reasoning
above. There are two points that the argument above makes. The
first regards the lack of consensus regarding morality. The
second involves the inability to prove the superiority of one
moral system over another using logic alone. 

It is true that throughout history, different cultures have
held vastly different beliefs about morality. These cultures have
also held vastly different beliefs regarding natural physical
laws. Consider, for example, the belief in gravity. Currently, it
is believed that the phenomena which we call gravity is the
result of the fact that objects with mass cause a curvature in
"space-time". Under this framework, we believe that a
clock located in a high gravitational field will appear to run
slower than an identical clock in a region with low gravity. We
also believe, under this framework, that the path of something
without mass, such as a beam of light, is affected by gravity.
This was not always the case. At the beginning of the twentieth
century, for example, it was believed that the phenomena of
gravity is the result of the fact that all objects with mass
exert an attractive force on each other. According to this view,
the path of a beam of light should be unaffected by gravity and
identical clocks should run at the same speed everywhere. This
had not always been the case either. At an earlier time it was
believed that the natural place for objects such as rocks was on
the ground while the natural place for things like steam was up
in the sky. According to this perspective, rocks fell to the
ground while steam rose because everything tends to go to its
natural place. If we do a more thorough examination, including
all the cultures throughout all of history, we will find an even
larger variety of opinions regarding the law of gravity. 

This does not, though, mean that there is no objective law of
gravity which exists independently of human society. The beliefs
in gravity which I described are attempts by human societies to
approximate reality. Clearly, some approximations are better than
others. Perhaps the current belief in the curvature of space-time
is also incorrect and will later be replaced by an even better
approximation. However, most people would have no problem
agreeing that the curvature of space-time explanation of gravity
is a better approximation to reality than the explanations which
came before it. 

All that this shows is that even though different cultures
hold very different beliefs about a certain issue, this does not
necessarily imply that there is no objective reality behind these
beliefs. The claim which I will be arguing for is that this is
the same for morality as it is for gravity. All the moral beliefs
which came before us and all the moral beliefs today are, in
exactly the same way as in the case of gravity, approximations to
the objective reality which exists independently of human beings.
Although probably none of these approximations correspond to
reality exactly, as with gravity, some approximations are better
than others. For example, the value system of a society which
condones slavery but condemns cannibalism is incorrect, but it is
a better approximation to reality than that of a society which
condones both slavery and cannibalism. 

The claim that no one has yet been able to prove the
correctness of a particular moral system through logic alone is
also correct. However, if we continue the analogy with gravity,
we will realize that no one has also been able to prove the
existence of gravity through logic alone either. The reason we
believe that a rock will fall to the ground is because that is
what we have always observed when we have let go of rocks in the
past. There is a little more to it than that, of course, but not
much. Our current theory of gravity predicts many specific
phenomena. These include rocks falling to the ground, planets
orbiting the Sun, the creation of ocean tides by the moon, and
identical clocks running at different speeds. The only reason why
we do believe in our current theory of gravity is because every
time we have observed these phenomena, what we saw corresponded
with what the theory predicted. If we were deprived of these
observations, we would have no reason to believe in gravity at
all. There is no way, using logic alone, that a person can prove
the existence of gravity or the superiority of one theory of
gravity to another. It is only by using logical reasoning in
combination with observation that a person can argue for the
existence of gravity. Even then, it is not be possible to do so
with total 100% assurance. The fact that the current theory of
gravity has always made correct predictions in the past does not
guarantee that the theory will give correct predictions tomorrow.
What a person can do, though, is to show, by using logical
reasoning in combination with observations, that our theory of
gravity is most likely true. 

This is what I intend to do for morality. There are, of
course, some differences in arguing for an objective moral law
and an objective gravitational law. Perhaps one of the most
significant is that it is possible to construct equipment which
quantitatively measure the effects of gravity. That is, it is
possible to construct a speed detector that tells you that a rock
is moving with a velocity of ten meters per second at a certain
moment in time. On the other hand, it is not currently possible
to construct a morality meter which tells you that a certain
action is wrong with an immorality of ten immorality units.
Nevertheless, this is an obstacle which I believe can easily be
overcome. I will explain the way in which I overcome this
obstacle a little bit later. For now, I would just like to point
out that the fact that we can not build such a detector does not
automatically imply that an objective morality does not exist. It
was not that long ago that we were unable to detect or measure
the existence of electrons. This, however, does not imply that
electrons did not exist in that time period. Electrons
(objectively) existed regardless of whether or not we could build
devices which detected them. The same, I believe, is true for
morality.   

  

  

  

I have divided my discussion into four parts. The first part
is this introduction. In the second part, I attempt to show that
it is objectively wrong to torture another person for pleasure,
and I discuss where this objective morality "comes
from". In this second part, I do not deal with something
even as mildly complicated as torturing one person to prevent the
suffering of another. Since I am trying to show that an objective
morality exists independently of human beliefs, just showing that
there exists one action which is objectively wrong should be
sufficient to demonstrate my position that some objective
morality exists. 

However, just believing that an objective morality exists
should not be enough to satisfy anyone’s inquiry into the
matter. In part three, I discuss how we can determine what this
objective morality says about controversial moral issues. As in
the case of gravity, I only claim to have a method to find good
approximations to this objective moral law, not to get it exactly
right the first time. By spending more time applying this method
to a particular moral issue, we will obtain better
approximations. I give examples of how this method can be applied
to issues such as abortion, war, animal rights, and forcing your
morality on others. I also discuss if an action which does not
harm anyone can be immoral and if it is ever correct to say that
one life is "worth more" than another. In addition, I
give a method for establishing a belief about if another being
possesses consciousness, which is useful in attempting to
determine if we have an obligation to act morally towards that
being. 

The fourth part is relatively independent of the rest of my
discussion. In part four, I briefly discuss other alternative
views about the nature and origin of morality. I touch on several
topics. I discuss how a belief in God can be reconciled with the
position which I advocate and why I think that it is not
logically consistent to hold the opinion that a belief in God is
necessary in order to believe in an objective morality. I discuss
moral systems based on ideas like karma and perfect justice which
are often associated with reincarnation. I also discuss a few
other views regarding morality and what I think their flaws are.
I talk about what I think is wrong with thinking of morality as
just a social behavior which evolved to help our survival. I also
discuss why I think that it is not possible to successfully base
the foundation of a society on self interest or a social
contract. I also mention why morality is much more than simply
attempting to maximize a certain quantity such as happiness.
Nowhere in my presentation do I discuss whether any particular
religion is correct or incorrect. I limit my presentation to
discussing the development of a belief in an objective morality
without appealing to religious teachings. I do, though, show how
my position can be reconciled with various religious beliefs. I
also show how the definition of morality which I am about to give
can be reconciled with the theory of evolution and natural
selection. In addition, I discuss if moral beliefs improve in the
long run with the passage of time.   

  

  

  

My definition of the word "morality" does not
correspond to the way in which the word is usually used, but I
believe that this definition closely approximates what
"morality" is. In order to better explain my
definition, I would first like to give an example of what
"morality" is not. 

Suppose that a man comes home after shopping for food at a
supermarket. When his son sees him, he comments on what good and
moral people the owners of the supermarket must be. He remarks
that the store owners must have been very kind and generous to
give all this food to his family. How do you think that his
father will answer? Clearly, the father will answer that the
supermarket owners did not give him the food because they were
kind or generous people, but because it was in their self
interest to do so. Although the store owners might indeed be good
and moral people, this action is in no way any indication of
this. They did what they did because they believed that the
action would profit them, and for no other reason. This action,
the father would conclude, says nothing about the morality of the
store owners. 

I will now give my definition. All actions can be placed into
one of two categories. Some actions can belong to both of these
groups simultaneously. However, all actions must belong to at
least one of these categories. The first group consists of all
actions which we do out of self interest while not harming
others. Simple examples of this are riding a bicycle or watching
television. These are activities which we engage in because we
believe that these activities will benefit us. If an action
belongs exclusively to this category, then it is of the same type
as that of the supermarket owners in the previous example, and
has nothing to do with morality. 

The second group consists of two types of behavior. The first
type is behavior which either harms or intends to harm others.
The second type is behavior which we engage in, not because we
believe that it will somehow benefit us in the long run, but
because we believe that it will benefit others. This includes any
action we do, and any action which we refrain from doing, not for
ourselves, but for others. It is with this second group of
behaviors with which morality is concerned. Morality, then, is
engaging in behavior, not out of self interest, but because it is
in the interest of others. This is how I define morality. 

Many people would argue that altruistic actions belonging to
the second group which I described do not exist. That is, they
would argue that every action every person does is done out of
self interest. If a man gives money to charity, they say, he does
so only because he gets a warm and fuzzy feeling inside. If a
woman donates blood, it is only because doing so makes her feel
good about herself. This line of reasoning claims that all these
seemingly benevolent actions are really done out of self
interest. That is, people engage in such activities only to get
these good internal feelings which they want. 

I disagree with such thinking. Although it is correct that a
woman who gives to charity will probably obtain a warm and fuzzy
feeling from doing so, it is incorrect to assume that this is the
only reason why she engages in this activity. This is an example
of an action which can simultaneously fit both of the groups
which I described. That is, this woman may be giving to charity
both because she feels good after doing so and because she wants
to help others. In this case, so long as it is not done entirely
out of self interest, it is still related to morality. Some
actions which people engage in fall exclusively into my second
category, and could never be explained in terms of self interest.
An extreme example of this is when a person, who does not believe
in an afterlife, makes a split second decision to give up his
life for others, as in a case of a soldier throwing his body on a
live hand grenade in order to save his comrades. There is no way
to argue that the soldier is doing this because he seeks a warm
and fuzzy feeling inside, since he is not going to live long
enough to enjoy it. 

Human beings often attempt to persuade others into behaving a
certain way by pointing out that it is in their self interest to
do so. A police officer may say, for example, that you
shouldn’t steal because there is a good chance that you will
go to jail if you do. Similarly, a mother may tell her son that
he will be punished if he is found misbehaving. None of this,
though, in any way influences anyone to become a moral person. It
just tells people how to behave in their own self interest. The
only lesson this would impart on the child is that if he wants to
avoid punishment, he should not misbehave. This will not prevent
him from misbehaving the moment he knows that his parents
aren’t watching, or after he grows up and moves out of his
parents’ house. Similarly, this type of reasoning will not
convince a person not to steal if he finds himself in a situation
where the chances of being caught are small or non-existent. Nor
is there, based on self interest alone, much reason for police
officers, judges, and law makers to not abuse the power of their
positions. 

What religions often do with regards to morality is to argue
that it is always in a person’s self interest to behave
"morally". Some religions teach, for example, that if
you engage in murder, rape, or torture, you will go to Hell.
Others teach that if you engage in such activities you are going
to have a very unfortunate next reincarnation. Others may believe
that there is no life after death, but that you will be punished
in this life for engaging in improper acts. However, this does
not really tell anyone to be a moral person. This, again, just
tells people how to behave in their self interest. If a woman
refrains from killing other people only because she does not want
to go to Hell, or if a man gives to charity only because he does
not want to be reincarnated as an insect, then these activities
have nothing to do with morality. As in the case of the
supermarket owner, these people are just acting in their self
interest. A religious person can, of course, be acting morally if
he engages in activities for the purpose of benefiting others as
well as seeking a reward. It is just that, as with the
supermarket owner, although an action may have the side effect of
benefiting other people, it is not related to morality if seeking
a reward or avoiding a punishment is the only motivation. 

But then the questions before us are the following. Without
making an appeal to religion, why is it that we
"should" behave "morally"? Why is it that we
"should" engage in activities which benefit others and
refrain from activities which harm others? In a situation where
which course of action is moral is itself a matter of debate, how
is it possible, without using religious concepts, to persuasively
argue that a particular answer is in fact the correct one. It is
these types of questions which I will attempt to answer.

## Proving the Existence of an Objective Morality

Let us suppose that we were attempting to use logic alone in
order to convince a skeptic that torturing another person for
pleasure is (objectively) immoral. We could say that torturing
another person for pleasure is immoral because it inflicts
suffering unnecessarily. However, this skeptic could then ask why
it is that inflicting needless suffering is immoral. In order to
answer this question, we would first have to explain what
suffering feels like. After all, if a person does not know what
suffering feels like, then he will never understand why it is
wrong to inflict it. However, how would we go about explaining
what suffering "feels like"? 

We could talk about the facial expressions or the verbal
sounds which the prisoner will make. However, this is not really
describing what suffering feels like, since an actor can produce
exactly the same symptoms without feeling any suffering, and
since it is possible to feel suffering while not displaying any
of these characteristics. We can talk about phenomena such as an
increased heart beat or respiration. However, this does not tell
us what suffering feels like either, since it is also possible to
have these symptoms without suffering and to suffer without
showing these symptoms. We could attempt to describe suffering as
the firing of a particular group sensory neurons in a particular
way. However, this too will not give us the answer we seek. We
could remove those neurons and place them in a test tube. Having
those sensory neurons fire in exactly the same way in the
laboratory would not involve any suffering. Simply knowing that
these sensory neurons are firing, or knowing any of these
mentioned measurable physical characteristics, would not really
tell us what suffering "feels like". 

The problem is analogous to attempting to describe to a blind
man what the color green looks like. We could explain to him that
light is a type of electromagnetic wave. We could then tell him
that "green" is light with a certain range of
frequencies. We could then also talk about which objects absorb
green light and which objects reflect green light. However, none
of this would get a blind man any closer to understanding what
"green" looks like. The only way we can currently
describe to a person what a color looks like is by comparing it
to other colors. We might say, for example, that
"green" is a cross between yellow and blue. However,
this is of no use to a blind man since he does not know what
yellow or blue look like either. 

This is exactly the problem we face in attempting to tell the
skeptic what suffering feels like. We could attempt to explain
what the tortured victim is feeling by comparing it to feelings
of suffering which the skeptic has experienced in the past.
However, a proof based only on logic can not make appeals to past
experiences or to sensations. If we wanted to use only logic to
prove that it is immoral to inflict needless suffering, we would
have to be able to explain what suffering "feels like"
using logic alone also. This, however, is not currently possible.
It is only here that an attempt to use logic alone to prove the
existence of an objective morality breaks down. This does not
mean, though, that we can not use a slightly different method to
argue for the existence of an objective morality.   

  

  

  

There are two different ways we can go about explaining the
probable truth of a statement. The first is by explaining why we
believe that the statement is true. The second is by attempting
to explain what causes the statement to be true. Take, for
example, the statement, "the sky looks blue".
Explaining why we believe that this statement is true is fairly
simple. We look up at the sky, and we see that it looks blue.
Explaining what causes this is statement to be true turns out to
be much more difficult. This would require explaining that light
is a type of wave and explaining the properties of wave
propagation. Only then would we really understand "why"
it is that light having the frequency associated only with the
color blue reaches our eyes when we look at the daytime sky. 

I will attempt to look at the statement "An objective
morality exists" from both of these perspectives. That is, I
will talk about why we should believe that the statement is true
and about what causes the statement to be true. However, as the
previous example shows, it is possible to know why we should
believe that a statement is probably true without knowing what
causes it to be true. The vast majority of people know that the
sky looks blue, and why it is that we should believe that the sky
looks blue, while they at the same time have almost no knowledge
of wave propagation. 

I will first discuss what "causes" the statement
"An objective morality exists" to be true. My claim is
that it is not necessary to believe in concepts like God or an
eternal soul in order to believe in an objective morality. One of
the main reasons so many people initially have a hard time
accepting such a claim is because one of the most popular
alternative views is that we are nothing more than a congregation
of atoms and molecules. In other words, the most popular
alternative view is that our consciousness is nothing more than
complicated electrochemical reactions in the brain. If such a
view is correct, they say, an objective morality can not possibly
exist. After all, there is no morality when it comes to the
physical laws governing the behavior of atoms and molecules. Our
laws of physics just tell us which way an electron will go. These
laws appear to say nothing about if it is "immoral" for
an electron to go in a particular direction. So if we are nothing
more than just a congregation of such particles, where could an
objective morality come from? 

I do not claim that such a view regarding consciousness is
correct. I do claim, though, that an objective morality exists
even if this type of view regarding consciousness does turn out
to be correct. It is true that there appears to be no morality on
the level of atoms and molecules. However, in exactly the same
manner, there is also no consciousness on the level of atoms and
molecules. It is not possible for an electron to feel happiness,
joy, or sorrow. Just as the laws of physics seem to say nothing
about morality, they also seem to say nothing about
consciousness. The people who want to believe that conscious
results from brain activity have to conclude that, although there
appears to be no consciousness in the laws of physics on the
atomic level, consciousness does arise through the complicated
interactions of these atoms and molecules according to physical
laws. If this turns out to be the case, then it certainly does
not seem to be any less plausible that in exactly the same way,
although there appears to be no morality in the laws of physics
on the atomic level, morality does arise through the complicated
interactions of these atoms and molecules according to physical
laws. This, so far, does not actually say that an objective
morality must exist. It just says that having morality arise from
physical laws is no more or less plausible than having
consciousness arise from physical laws in exactly the same way. 

Some people have trouble imagining how it is that a
congregation of atoms, which we call a human being, can possibly
have a property such as an obligation to act morally, which does
not also exist on the atomic level. There are many analogies
which can help to illustrate this. One is a wave traveling down a
rope. If you look very closely at any of the individual atoms in
the rope, you will not find this "wave" of the rope in
any of these rope atoms at any given time. It is only when you
stand back and look at the entire rope that you can see this wave
and the properties by which it travels. This does not, however,
imply that this wave does not arise from the basic laws governing
the motion of the rope atoms. Another analogy is a neon sign. A
detailed analysis of the individual atoms in the sign will never
tell you that the sign spells "Joe’s Diner". I
would like to say again that I am not trying to argue that human
beings are just a collection of atoms and molecules. I am just
pointing out that a belief in an objective morality is perfectly
consistent with such a view.   

  

  

  

The analogy between morality and consciousness is not as
arbitrary as it might first appear. If we really wanted to know
what could cause a statement such as "Inflicting suffering
on another person for pleasure is immoral" to be true, we
would first have to understand the nature and origin of
suffering. This is because it would not be possible to know
"why" it is wrong to inflict suffering without knowing
what suffering is. As I mentioned before, suffering from physical
pain is not the firing of any particular group of sensory
neurons. Suffering is the way our consciousness interprets the
firing of those neurons. 

Explaining terms like "tree" or "rainbow"
is fairly simple. To explain the term "tree", all you
have to do is point to a tree. To explain what the term
"rainbow", all you have to do is point to a rainbow.
However, when you attempt to explain the term
"suffering", there is nothing to point to. Suffering is
a feeling, and we can not point to feelings in this manner.
"Suffering" is a state of consciousness.
"Suffering" can not exist without consciousness. In
order to really understand the nature and origin of suffering, we
would have to understand the nature and origin of consciousness. 

As mentioned before, there are some people who believe that
consciousness is entirely the result of the electrochemical
reactions occurring in the brain. Others believe that it is the
result of a soul which exists independently of the brain and
body. There are many other possible answers to where it is that
consciousness comes from. If it turns out that consciousness is
nothing more than electrochemical reactions in the brain, then we
can understand how suffering arises from these electrochemical
reactions by understanding how consciousness arises from such
reactions. However, we do not currently understand how
consciousness arises from brain activity, so we can not currently
understand how suffering arises from brain activity. If it turns
out that consciousness is the result of something similar to a
soul, then we could understand the nature and origin of suffering
by understanding the nature and properties of this soul. Needless
to say, we do not know this either. 

It is only for these reasons that we do not yet have a
complete answer to what "causes" a statement such as
"It is objectively immoral to inflict suffering just for the
heck of it" to be true. Perhaps one day in the future, we
will have a thorough understand what "causes"
consciousness. It is only then that we would really know what the
nature and origin of suffering is. It is also only then that we
would really know what "causes" it to be immoral to
inflict suffering just for the heck of it. 

We do not, though, have to wait till that day to find out if
an objective morality exists and what this objective morality is.
As I said before, it is not necessary to understand what causes a
phenomena to be true in order to understand what that phenomena
is. For example, in order to understand what path a rock will
take when you throw it, all you have to do is use the classical
Newtonian rules of motion which have been known for some time. If
you really wanted an answer to what "causes" the rock
to take that path, though, you would have to understand the way
in which the mass of the Earth affects the curvature of
"space-time", something which we knew nothing about
before the twentieth century. However, even if you know
absolutely nothing about modern physics, you could still know how
to accurately predict the path that a rock will take when you
throw it.   

  

  

  

Let us focus once again on the issue of torturing another
person for pleasure. Even though we do not understand the nature
and origin of suffering in the manner I described above, we know
what suffering is because we have experienced it ourselves. It is
only in understanding what suffering is in this manner that we
come to understand that it is wrong for others to inflict it on
us needlessly. This is not the same thing as simply observing the
fact that we dislike the experience of suffering. The only way to
understand this difference, again, is to experience what
"dislike" is and what "suffering" is. I do
not claim that experiencing suffering will necessarily cause
anyone to realize that it is wrong for them to inflict suffering
on others. For now, I am just claiming that by understanding what
suffering is by experiencing a significant amount of it directly,
a person will realize that it is objectively wrong for others to
inflict needless suffering on him. 

There are many objections which can be raised against this
claim. In order to argue for the validity of my claim, I must do
more than simply show why these objections are not valid. Before
I proceed, though, I would like to point out the flaws in several
of the most common types of objections people would most likely
have. 

A person may ask about the masochists who enjoy experiencing
physical pain. Such individuals do exist, and a person can ask
how this can be reconciled with my position. The answer is that
suffering is not the same thing as physical pain. Just as a
person does not need to feel physical pain in order to feel
suffering, a person also does not need to feel suffering in order
to feel physical pain. If a masochist feels enjoyment when he
experiences physical pain, then clearly he is not feeling
suffering during that time period. It is only when the masochist
has an experience which really does cause him to suffer that he
will realize that it is wrong for others to inflict suffering on
him for entertainment. 

A person can ask how the existence of moral relativists can be
reconciled with my position. These are people who genuinely
believe that no objective morality exists. Since they have all
experienced suffering in the past, why do they not believe that
it is objectively wrong for others to inflict suffering on them?
First, I need to say that when I referred to "a significant
amount suffering", I was not necessarily referring to a
tooth ache. For some people, experiencing a tooth ache is enough.
The knowledge of what a tooth ache feels like is enough to allow
them to extrapolate to what the experience of being tortured
probably feels like. For others, experiencing a tooth ache is not
enough. There are some people who have been fortunate enough to
live a life without experiencing much suffering. 

Nevertheless, there are moral relativists who have experienced
a significant amount of suffering in their lives. I still need to
explain how their existence can be reconciled with my position.
The answer is that the memory of experiencing suffering is not
the same thing as the experience of suffering itself. The process
of recalling the memory of a tooth ache you had a few months ago
does not bring about the same agony as the tooth ache itself did.
For this reason, simply recalling the memory of a painful
experience might not be enough. We do not truly fully appreciate
what suffering "is" except for the moment in which we
are experiencing it. For some people, I believe, the memory of
having experienced suffering in the past is enough to make them
realize that it is wrong for others to inflict suffering on them
just for entertainment. For others, the actual experience is
required. I believe that it would not be possible, for example,
to find any moral relativists among the prisoners of a Nazi death
camp. After a few years go by, however, it is perfectly possible
that some of the survivors of this camp will look back on their
experience and still become moral relativists. 

Another objection which can be raised is the following. It
appears that the existence of morality depends on the existence
of conscious beings. If it turns out that consciousness has not
always existed in the Universe, then it appears that morality did
not always exist either. It is possible to respond to this
objection by again making the comparison to gravity. You would
not see the law of gravity being applied in a region of space
without objects possessing mass. This does not imply that the law
of gravity does not exist in that region of space. In a similar
manner, the law of morality still exists in a region of space or
in a time period without conscious beings. We just do not see it
being applied. 

Another objection which can be raised to my position is that
it relies too heavily on personal experience. It can be pointed
out that since my belief that a particular action is
"objectively immoral" relies on personal experience,
and since different people have different personal experiences,
different people are going to end up with different moralities.
The morality of a person who has almost never experienced
suffering, for example, is going to be very different from the
morality of a person who’s life has been almost nothing
except suffering. This, it would appear, does not make my
morality very objective. 

The way to respond to this objection is by recalling the fact
that, due to different observations, people in different time
periods have had widely different views about physical laws as
well. At one time, for example, it was believed that gravity
results because all objects with mass exert an attractive force
on one another. Today it is believed that gravity results because
objects with mass cause a curvature in "space-time".
The reason that people in the 19th century believed differently
about gravity than people do today is not because the people
living in the 19th century were less intelligent. It is only
because people living in the 19th century did not have access to
the same experimental observations which people had access to in
the 20th century. All science is based on observation, whether it
be the observation of a chance occurrence or the observation of a
controlled laboratory experiment. It is perfectly in accordance
with the scientific method for a belief to be based on
observation. It is also in accordance with the scientific method
for people who have access to different sets of observation to
come to different conclusions. All scientific laws and theories
are only approximations to reality. The greater the number and
variety of observations on which a theory is based, the greater
the odds that it better approximates reality. 

There are many people, however, who would find fault with this
comparison to the scientific method. Scientific theories, they
would argue, are based on repeatable observations which are
performed many times by different observers. It must be possible
for these observations to be reproduced by anyone at any time. My
position relies on "personal" observations, they would
continue, which do not meet this criteria. Well, let’s check
to see if this accusation is true. Are these observations
repeatable? Clearly the answer is yes. Dropping a bowling ball on
your foot is probably going to hurt just as much today as it will
tomorrow. We can easily reproduce the experience of suffering for
any observer at any given time. I, of course, believe that doing
so would be immoral and would not recommend this course of
action. Nevertheless, my argument from an individual’s
"personal observations" does meet the reproducibility
requirement of scientific observations.   

  

  

  

So far, I have not actually provided an argument for my claim.
Up till now, I have only shown flaws in various objections to my
claim. Ultimately, the objection which can be raised is that
perhaps the only thing which we really observe when we experience
suffering is that we dislike the experience. Perhaps the
perception that something is "objectively wrong" is
nothing more than an illusion. After all, we can not construct a
device which measures the "morality" of an action. So
why should we believe that "morality" is anything more
than a figment of our imagination? Also, why should my claim be
accepted by a person who has never had the impression that it is
wrong for others to inflict suffering on him? 

There are two cases I have to address. The first is the case
of a person who has felt the impression that it is objectively
wrong for others to needlessly inflict suffering on him, but
chose to believe that it was just an illusion. I have to explain
why this person should believe that he was observing more than
the simple fact that he dislikes suffering. The second is the
case of a person who claims never to have felt the impression
that it is objectively immoral for others to inflict suffering on
him. 

I will start with the first case by tackling the issue of the
lack of a "morality detector". As I mentioned in the
introduction, it is true that we can not currently construct a
measuring device which would indicate to us when an action is
immoral. So it follows that we can not build a measuring device
that tells us that it is "objectively immoral" for
another person to torture us. Does this, though, imply that an
"objective morality" does not exist? 

While attempting to answer this question, it is necessary to
keep in mind that we also can not build a measuring device which
detects suffering. We can build instruments which measure the
responses of the brain and body. However, none of these can
measure what suffering "feels like". Since suffering is
nothing more than a "feeling", we are just as incapable
of measuring suffering with scientific instruments as we are at
measuring morality. Should we, as a result, believe that
suffering does not exist? Should we believe that suffering is
nothing more than an illusion? Clearly, the answer is no.
Suffering really does exist. We all believe that it exists in
spite of the fact that we can not build measuring devices which
indicate this to us. It would not be consistent for a person to
reject as an illusion his "observation" that it is
wrong for another person to inflict needless suffering on him,
while at the same time accepting as an objective truth his
observation that suffering exists. If a person rejects one of
these conclusions because we do not have such measuring devices,
then to be consistent, he should reject both of these
conclusions. Similarly, if he accepts one of these conclusions as
probably true, he should accept both of these conclusions as
probably true. This does not apply to a person who has never
experienced the "observation" that it is wrong for
others to inflict suffering on him just for the heck of it. Here,
I am simply referring to a person who has had this experience but
afterwards chose to think of it as an illusion. 

At this point, someone may say that he does not believe that
there is anything objective about the existence of suffering
either. The experience of suffering, this person might respond,
is never identical in any two people. This, he could continue,
prevents suffering from being objective. If this is the case,
then we are simply disagreeing on the use of the word
"objective". When I say that a statement is
"objectively true", all I mean is that it is actually
the "correct" position. If a patient is experiencing
suffering, perhaps no one else will ever know exactly what he is
feeling. Nevertheless, the statement "the patient is
experiencing suffering" is an objectively true statement in
the sense that it will remain true regardless of what anyone
thinks. 

But still, a moral relativist can point out that it is
possible that the only thing which we really perceive when we
experience suffering is that we dislike it. Perhaps our senses
are simply misleading us to believe that it is
"immoral" for others to inflict suffering on us
needlessly. I have to admit that this is a logically consistent
possibility. Nevertheless, we have to put at least some trust in
our senses. We should always be aware that there is a possibility
that our senses are deceiving us, and that what we see or hear
has no correspondence to reality. But, in the absence of further
information, we should conclude that what our senses tell us
probably has some correspondence to reality. Just as it is a
logically consistent possibility that the perception of an
objective morality is an illusion, there are many other things
which are also logically consistent possibilities. Perhaps your
entire life is nothing but a dream and no external reality
exists. Perhaps the existence of a "free will" is just
an illusion and we have no control over our thoughts or actions.
Perhaps the belief that time moves forward is just an illusion,
while in reality it has always been frozen at this instant. These
are all logically consistent possibilities, yet most people do
not believe them. In the absence of further information, most
people choose to believe their senses and conclude that there is
an external reality, that there is a free will, and that time
does move forward. Similarly, in the absence of further
information, a person should choose to believe his senses and
conclude that it is immoral for others to torture him for
entertainment. 

But what about a person who does not believe in an objective
morality and who claims to never have had the impression that it
is wrong for others to inflict suffering on him? Why should
anything I have said influence his position? Well, if I have done
nothing else, I hope I have at least demonstrated how the belief
that certain actions are objectively immoral can be reconciled
with all of our current scientific beliefs. I think that one of
the main reasons that there are so many moral relativists is that
many people, for one reason or another, believe that the
existence of an objective morality is not logically consistent
with our current scientific theories. At the very least, I hope I
have dispelled these reservations. 

When you debate with another person, it is not actually
possibly for "you" to change their mind about a certain
issue. Only they can do this for themselves. All you can do is
present them with reasons for them to change their mind. As an
extreme example, let us say that you were debating with a person
who believed that the Earth was flat. You can show him the most
recent photographs of the Earth from a space shuttle, but this
will not necessarily convince him. He can still believe that
these photographs are a forgery and that there is a government
conspiracy to brainwash the population into believing that the
Earth is round. You can not "force" him to believe in a
round Earth. All you can do is present your side of the argument
and hope that this will influence him to rethink his position. 

The same is true with morality. Just as it is not possible to
"make" a person believe in a round Earth, it is not
possible to "make" a person believe in an objective
morality. In the case of the Earth, though, you can draw the
person’s attention to the photographs from the space shuttle
and hope he will reexamine his beliefs in light of this. In the
case of a person who does not believe that is objectively wrong
for others to torture him, similarly, all you can do is draw the
person’s attention to his own past experiences of suffering
and hope that this will cause him to rethink his position.   

  

  

  

So far, I have only claimed that by understanding what
suffering is by experiencing it, a person can realize that it is
objectively wrong for others to torture him. I have not yet shown
why this should cause anyone to believe that it is wrong for them
to torture others. This is the issue which I will now address.
What is to prevent a person from believing that it is objectively
wrong for others to torture him but that it is perfectly OK for
him to torture others? 

Our current scientific beliefs about the world rest on the
assumption that the physical laws of the universe do not change
and are the same everywhere. For example, our belief that
galaxies are moving away from each other rests on the assumption
that the laws of physics operate the same way in other galaxies
as they do in our own. Otherwise, there would be no way to
interpret as "red-shifted" the light which we receive
from those galaxies. The point I am trying to make is that if we
choose to reject the assumption that laws which govern the
Universe are the same everywhere and unchanging, then we would
have to also reject the vast majority of our scientific beliefs.
So it appears that for the purposes of my argument, this
assumption that these laws are "universal" is a fairly
safe assumption to make. 

If a person admits that it is objectively immoral for others
to torture him, then he is admitting that there is some external
"law" which makes it immoral. Operating under the
assumption which I have just mentioned, this law must continue
operating unchanged after a passage of time or a change in
location. Therefore, if it is objectively immoral for another
person to torture you, then it must also be immoral for you to
torture another person. 

But someone might protest. A person can claim that the two
situations are not really the same. In one case, he is being
tortured by another person. In the second, another person is
being tortured by him. He could attempt to claim that this
"universal law" only states that it is wrong for others
to torture him. Well, what exactly do we mean when we say that a
physical law is the same at all places and at all times? When we
say that a rock will fall to the ground due to gravity, do we
mean just that one rock? What if we claimed that this law of
gravity only stated that one particular rock will fall to the
ground, while other rocks do not necessarily follow this pattern
due to the fact that they are not the same rock? If this is the
case, then our claim that this is a law which is the same
everywhere at all times would be an extremely hollow claim. If
this is truly a "universal law" then it has to apply to
all rocks. Similarly, such a "universal law" of
morality would have to apply to all people. Otherwise, it
wouldn’t be very universal. 

There is one problem, though. I claimed that we can only
understand what suffering is by experiencing it ourselves. If
this is the case, how can we ever tell if another individual is
experiencing suffering? This question might appear trivial to
some people. However, in some controversial moral issues, this
question is at the very heart of the matter. In the case of
abortion, for example, whether or not a fetus can feel suffering
is sometimes at the center of the debate. Another example is a
debate concerning if we have an obligation to act morally towards
insects. A person’s position on such an issue is going to
strongly depend on that person’s belief about if insects are
capable of suffering. I will leave such questions for part three
of my discussion. For now, I will just focus on how to determine
if another healthy adult human being is experiencing suffering.
How this question is answered, though, will play an important
role in determining how these other questions are answered. 

Suppose that the prisoner who is going to be tortured is an
enemy prisoner of war who does not speak our language. Also,
there is no interpreter around. Let us hypothetically suppose
that a person claimed that it is not immoral to torture this
prisoner because this prisoner does not feel any suffering. How
can we refute this claim? In other words, since we only know what
suffering feels like by experiencing it ourselves, how can we
determine if this prisoner is experiencing suffering. The answer
is that we can never know with 100% confidence that another
individual is experiencing suffering. We can, however, know that
another individual is most probably experiencing suffering. 

We know how we would react if we were in the prisoner’s
position. We know how our body language and facial expression
would react to torture. We know what kind of verbal sounds we
would make. We also know how our heartbeat and various other
measurable features would respond to this torture. We also know
that we would suffer. What do we see when we look at this
prisoner who is being tortured? We see that his facial expression
and body language is vary similar to what ours would be in that
situation. We see that the verbal sounds, heart beat, and other
measurable features of this tortured prisoner very closely
resemble how we ourselves would react. Since all these measurable
characteristics are very close to what they would be in
ourselves, then we can argue by induction that the characteristic
which we can not measure, that of suffering, is also probably the
same in this prisoner as they would be in ourselves. This is like
arguing that if all you know is that the Sun has risen for the
last thousand mornings, then it will probably rise again
tomorrow. So we are able to conclude that this prisoner is most
probably suffering as a result of torture, and that therefore it
is immoral for us to continue torturing him.   

  

  

  

In summary, an extremely simplified version of my position is
the following. Moral laws are of the same nature as the laws of
gravity and heat transfer. It is true that it is not possible to
use logic alone to explain why it is wrong to inflict suffering
on another. However, that is only because it is impossible to
logically explain what suffering is. It is only by experiencing
suffering ourselves that we can come to understand what suffering
is and the fact that it is wrong to inflict it needlessly. This,
however, should not come as a surprise. All science is based on
observation.

## Determining what the Objective Morality is

  

[Click Here to Go Back to the Index](morals.html) 

[Click Here to Go Back to Part Two](part2.html) 

  

If it is true that an objective morality exists, then we need
a method for determining what this objective morality is. For
example, how can we determine when, if ever, it is permissible to
kill another person? Let us suppose that we have already agreed
that it is objectively immoral to kill another person just for
entertainment. That is, suppose that by understanding what the
desire to continue living "feels like" by experiencing
it, a person concludes that it is objectively wrong for others to
kill him for entertainment. Then, by realizing that he is not
that much different from anyone else, he concludes that it is
wrong to kill others for entertainment also. How can he determine
if there are circumstances under which it is permissible to kill
and what these circumstances are? Suppose, for instance, that a
gunman enters a store and begins to shoot people. Suppose also
that the only way to stop this gunman is by shooting and killing
him. Is killing the gunman the correct thing to do? 

The first question we have to answer is this. Does the
existence of a universal moral law imply that an action which is
immoral in one situation must be immoral in all situations? We
can answer this by looking at another "universal law",
the law of gravity. If you are standing on the Earth and let go
of a ball, you will see the ball fall down. If you let go of a
ball when you are in a spaceship out in deep space, however, you
will see the ball remain where it is. The fact that there exists
a universal law of gravity does not imply that if a ball falls
down in one situation, it must fall down in all situations.
Similarly, just because an action is immoral in one situation, it
does not necessarily mean that it is wrong in all situations. The
fact that it is immoral to kill another person for entertainment
does not automatically imply that it is wrong to kill this gunman
in the store. 

Let us suppose that we knew absolutely nothing about the laws
of physics. Let us also suppose that we were told that when you
let go of a ball in a spaceship located in deep space, that a
very different result occurs than when you let go of a ball on
Earth. Believing that physical laws do not change and are the
same everywhere, we would at first be very puzzled. We would
attempt to discover what the distinguishing characteristic is
between the ball on Earth and the ball in the spaceship. Our
confusion would go away, though, the moment that we realized that
there is an extremely massive object next to the ball on Earth,
namely the Earth itself, while there is no such massive object
next to the ball in the spaceship. Even if we knew nothing about
physics, we would for the moment be content because we have
pointed out a distinguishing characteristic between the two
situations which could cause the results of letting go of a ball
to be very different. 

Similarly, we can believe that one action, such as killing
another person for entertainment, is immoral, while
simultaneously believing that another similar action, such as
killing this gunman in the store, is not immoral. However, in
order to do so, we should be able to point out the characteristic
which distinguishes the two actions, as we did in the case of
letting go of a ball. In this case, the distinguishing
characteristic is that killing the gunman is the only way to
prevent the gunman from deliberately killing many other people. 

Often, however, it can be pointed out to us that the
distinguishing characteristic we have picked is flawed. In this
case, we will not be able to use this characteristic to
differentiate the two actions. For example, let us suppose that
when we were told the story of letting go of the two balls, we
were also told that the ball in the spaceship was yellow while
the ball on Earth was purple. If we genuinely knew nothing about
physics, we might at first guess that it is the color of the ball
which is the distinguishing characteristic. That is, perhaps the
ball in the spaceship stays where it is because it is yellow,
while the ball on Earth falls to the ground because it is purple.
The problem with this is that someone could point out to us that
yellow balls here on Earth fall to the ground as well. If the
color of the ball was really the distinguishing characteristic,
yellow balls on Earth should not fall to the ground either.
However, since they do, color can not be the distinguishing
characteristic. 

Let us return to the case of the gunman in the store. Let us
suppose that we claimed that the distinguishing characteristic
between killing this individual and killing a person for
entertainment is that killing the gunman will save more lives in
the long run. That is, although we killed one person, we saved
more. A person can point out the flaw in such reasoning by
pointing out a hypothetical situation. Suppose that there are two
people who need an organ transplant. One of them needs a heart
and the other needs a liver. We know that we will not receive
these organs from any organ donor in time to save the lives of
these two individuals. We are also guaranteed, with 100%
certainty, that these operations will be a success provided we
had the organs. So, to save more lives in the long run, we decide
to kill an innocent bystander and give his organs to them. In
doing so, we have taken one life but saved two. So if saving more
lives in the long run is really the distinguishing
characteristic, then this must be the appropriate course of
action. We are now left with two choices. Either we have to
conclude that choosing involuntary organ donors in this manner is
acceptable in this hypothetical situation, or we have to conclude
that "saving more lives in the long run" is not an
appropriate distinguishing characteristic. Let us suppose that,
for some other reasons, we believe that this process of choosing
involuntary organ donors is not acceptable. Let’s say that,
by imagining how we would feel if we or one of our family members
were chosen to be this involuntary organ donor, we conclude that
it is immoral to kill a person for his organs in this manner. In
this case, we have to conclude that the distinguishing
characteristic which we initially thought of is not valid. 

There is, of course, another way to point out that a
particular "distinguishing characteristic" is flawed.
In the case of the two balls, even if we only knew a little bit
about physics, we could easily point out that the color of a ball
can not account for such drastically different behavior.
Similarly, let us suppose that someone claimed that killing this
gunman is acceptable because he has green eyes. Let us even
suppose that this person was consistent in that he believed that
it is OK to kill all people with green eyes. Even if we did not
know much about this "moral law", we could point out
that the color of a person’s eyes can not account for such
drastically different results. That is, the immorality of
shooting another person probably has something to do with that
person’s desire to live or ability to experience suffering.
Even if we did not know what this moral law is, we could point
out that the immorality of shooting another person does not arise
from that person’s eye color. 

The way, then, to determine if a particular action is immoral
or not is the following. One person can claim that a certain
action is objectively immoral by comparing it to another action
which we have already agreed is objectively immoral. Another
person can object to this claim in two ways. The first way is by
pointing out a distinguishing characteristic between the two
actions. This type of objection can be refuted by pointing out a
flaw in this distinguishing characteristic. The second way to
object to the claim is by comparing this particular action to
another action which we have agreed is not immoral. In this case,
the tables would be turned. The way to refute this second type of
objection is to point out a distinguishing characteristic between
the action which we have agreed is not immoral and the action in
question. In this case it would be up to the person making the
objection to point out the flaw in the distinction. 

The scenarios which people come up with in order to make or
refute an objection need not be realistic ones. They only have to
be hypothetical situations which help illustrate a moral
principle. The same principle holds in physics. Scenarios
involving spaceships moving at half the speed of light are not
very realistic. These scenarios, however, are often used to
illustrate concepts in the Theory of Relativity. 

I believe that it is important for me to emphasize the fact
that, just like the scientific method, this method is not
guaranteed to give exactly the correct answer the first time. It
is fairly common for new scientific theories to overthrow and
replace previous theories. There are not many scientists who
actually believe that all our current theories describe reality
exactly. What they do believe is that the theories closely
approximate reality. The longer the scientific method is applied,
the better an approximation our theories will be to reality. The
same is true for this method of determining morality. Our
reasoning will give us a belief which is an approximation to the
true morality. However, this belief can later be overthrown and
replaced by a new one. Perhaps someone in the future will, for
example, think of a flaw in one of our "distinguishing
characteristics" which we did not think of. Using this
method, our moral beliefs, as time goes by, will closer
approximate the true morality. 

This method can perhaps be can be called "moral reasoning
by analogy". I will give examples how this method can be
applied to various controversial moral issues. However, I would
first like to point out examples of what are not valid objections
to a statement like "this action is immoral". Perhaps
the most common one is, "This action is not immoral because
the vast majority of society believes that it is not
immoral". Truth is not democratic. The world does not become
flat just because the majority of the people think that it is. I
am writing this in 1996. Fifty years ago, segregation was
considered acceptable by the vast majority of the population in
the United States. Two hundred years ago, slavery was considered
acceptable by the majority of the world. Two thousand years ago,
it was considered acceptable in Europe to feed prisoners to lions
for public entertainment. If you look further back, it was not
considered immoral to have servants buried alive with their
recently deceased master. In each case, morality progressed
because some people looked at the morality of the majority of the
population and concluded that it needed to be improved. Now is no
better a time to think that we have it all figured out than were
any of these other points in history. 

We should also never attempt to justify our actions by
pointing out that others behave similarly or worst. We have an
obligation to act morally regardless of how other people are
behaving. This holds true for nations as well as individuals.
Nations often attempt to justify their questionable actions by
pointing out that their adversaries behave even worst. This is
not a valid justification. 

Another objection which is not valid is saying something
similar to, "This action is not immoral because my religion
says it is OK". I will discuss what is wrong with this
objection in part four. For now I will just point out that
Judaism, Christianity, and Islam all seem to explicitly state
that slavery is not immoral. Nevertheless, the majority of the
people who currently believe in those religions also believe that
slavery, in fact, is immoral. In part four, I will explain how
such beliefs can be reconciled. For now, I would just like to
state that it is possible for a person to believe that an action
is immoral even though it is permitted by his religion.
Otherwise, the people who believe in the three religions I
mentioned would have to conclude that there is nothing wrong with
slavery. 

The truth of a moral statement should also not be evaluated by
how difficult it is to implement it. Attempting to get rid of
slavery several hundred years ago would have involved enormous
practical difficulties, since many economies depended on it.
Nevertheless, slavery was just as immoral then as it is now. Just
as smoking does not become less dangerous due to the fact that it
is difficult to quit, an action does not become less immoral due
to the fact that it is difficult to stop doing it. 

I will now give examples of how the method I have described
can be used on various issues while continuing to explain the
method. I would like to point out again that the conclusions I
reach are not the final say on the matter. I am not giving these
examples in order to convert people to my position on these
issues, but just to illustrate how this method can be applied.
Many of my positions are going to be extremely unpopular, and
will seem to go against much of what we have been taught. But
then, if someone in the Roman Empire had claimed that it was
immoral to feed prisoners to lions for entertainment, he would
have gotten the same reaction. The first example I give is
determining if it is immoral to eat meat. I spend more time on
the first example than I do most of the others. This is because I
use the first example to illustrate common types of flaws in
objections people may have to a moral claim. 

  

  

  

  

### Eating meat

The way a person can claim that it is wrong to eat meat is by
comparing it to cannibalism. That is, since it is immoral to eat
human beings, it is in the same manner immoral to eat other
animals. This, of course, rests on the assumption that it is
immoral to kill human beings for the purpose of eating them. Let
us suppose that we have already agreed that it is immoral to eat
other human beings. Perhaps we came to this conclusion by
imagining how we would like it if we were killed for food. The
question which we have to answer is if we can come up with a
valid objection to the comparison between eating human beings and
eating other animals. 

The first distinguishing characteristic which we can come up
with is the fact that in one case you are eating human beings,
while in the other case you are eating animals. This, someone can
claim, is the distinguishing characteristic between the two
actions. This type of objection, though, can easily be refuted by
pointing out that human beings are animals. There are some
people, of course, who do not believe in the theory of evolution
and who do not believe that human beings are animals. Regardless
of if the person making the objection believes that humans are
animals, he can easily rephrase his objection to avoid this
difficulty. He could claim that that the distinguishing
characteristic between the two actions is that in one, you are
eating human beings, while in the other, you are eating animals
which are not human beings. This, however, is not really a valid
objection either. 

Let us recall the example of letting go of a ball in a
spaceship and letting go of a ball on Earth. We knew that the
balls behave differently and we were asked what the
distinguishing characteristic was between the two cases. What if
we had answered that the distinguishing characteristic was that
one was the ball which we let go in the spaceship, while the
other was the ball which we let go of on Earth? In this case, we
would not really be answering the question. The question which we
were faced with was what specific feature made the two cases
different. Similarly, simply saying that in one case you are
eating humans while in the other case you are eating animals
other than humans is not really answering the question either.
The question with which we are faced with is if there is a
feature which is possessed only by humans, which could make it
immoral to eat humans but not immoral to eat other animals. Just
saying "the feature of being human" is no more of an
answer than saying "the feature of being the ball in the
spaceship". 

Since "eating meat" is my first example, I think
that it is necessary to further point out why attempting to come
up with such simple distinctions is not valid. If such a simple
distinction was valid, a racist could claim that it is immoral to
eat people of European background, while it is permissible to eat
people with African background. The distinction between the two
cases, this person could claim, is that in one case you are
eating a person from European background, while in the other you
are eating a person with African background. Clearly, this is not
really answering the question of if there exists a distinguishing
feature between people of European background and people of
African background which would make it OK to eat one but not the
other. 

So in order to come up with a valid distinguishing
characteristic between eating a pig and eating a human, we have
to point out a feature which is possessed by humans but not by
pigs. Also, since we are operating under the assumption that it
is immoral to eat human beings, this feature must be possessed by
all human beings. The first such feature most people initially
think of is a superior intelligence and a superior brain. The
problem with this is that, although it is true that humans are
smarter than pigs on average, this is not true for all humans.
Newborn infants, the severely mentally retarded, certain people
with brain damage, and some elderly people who’s minds have
deteriorated all have levels of intelligence which are not
superior to that of pigs. Although intelligence is not something
which can be measured the way in which we can measure the mass of
a ball or the volume of a liquid, any test attempting to measure
intelligence which we apply equally to both pigs and to these
humans will not show these types of humans scoring higher than
the pigs. 

The objection can be modified to say that the distinguishing
characteristic is that human beings have a potential for a high
level of intelligence. This feature may be shared by the infants,
but it is not shared by the other humans which I have mentioned.
But a person can point out that it is not impossible that some
medical treatment will be developed some time in the future to
treat these humans. However, this can be refuted by saying that,
in a similar manner, it is not impossible that a procedure can be
developed in the future which can increase the intelligence of
the animals we eat. The only reason I am bringing this up is to
illustrate that the various scenarios people come up with in
order to make or refute an objection do not necessarily have to
be realistic ones. It is not very likely that a person with brain
damage who has certain parts of his brain missing is going to
have his condition reversed in his lifetime. Nevertheless,
someone can claim that this is not impossible, and that this is
what distinguishes him from a pig. However, if it is not
physically impossible that artificial brain components will be
constructed for this person, it is also not physically impossible
that someone will create extra brain components for a pig. This
does not mean that anyone is ever even going to attempt to create
such a "treatment", it just says that it is not
physically impossible. This objection and response to the
objection are, of course, extremely bizarre. As I said, I bring
it up primarily to show that these scenarios need not be
realistic. Earlier, when I gave the scenario of the involuntary
organ donor, I claimed that we were guaranteed that the operation
would be a success. This too was an unrealistic scenario.
However, it helped illustrate a moral concept. 

Another distinguishing characteristic which a person can think
of is that these mentally deficient humans have other humans,
with high intelligence, who care about them. However, it is not
that difficult to imagine a case of a severely mentally retarded
human who has no friends or relatives, and who’s death would
not be noticed much by anyone. Another distinguishing
characteristic which someone could come up with is that the
animals we eat are raised in captivity specifically for the
purpose of eating them. However, we could imagine a hypothetical
society which raised a certain race of humans in captivity
specifically for the purpose of eating them.   

  

  

  

So far, we have been unable to find a feature possessed by all
humans which is not also possessed by the animals humans eat. A
person, though, can object in another way to the statement that
eating meat is immoral. He can try to compare it to another
action which we have agreed is not immoral. For example, he can
compare it to eating plants. Let us suppose that we agree that
eating plants is not immoral. It is now up to the person claiming
that eating meat is immoral to point out a distinguishing
characteristic between eating plants and eating meat. This,
though, is fairly easily done. The animals which humans eat are
conscious beings who are capable of feeling joy, suffering, and a
desire to live. Plants, on the other hand, are not conscious and
can not feel anything whatsoever. This is a reasonable objection
to the comparison. There are some people, though, who will argue
in perfect seriousness that perhaps plants feel pain and
suffering or that perhaps other animals are not capable of
feeling pain or suffering. I will address this issue later in the
section titled "Determining if another being possesses
consciousness" which is after the section on abortion. For
now, under the assumption that plants, just like rocks, do not
feel anything whatsoever, this is a valid objection to the
comparison between eating meat and eating plants. 

A person can also compare humans eating meat to the way in
which other animals eat each other. The argument could go that
lions eat zebras, but lions do not eat other lions. Since animals
in general eat members of other species, the argument can
continue, but do not eat members of their own species, why
shouldn’t we emulate the practice? There are problems with
this argument even if such a statement were true. I think it is
important to point out, though, that this statement is not true.
Cannibalism is quite common among animals. Lions eat other lions,
bears eat other bears, and chimpanzees eat other chimpanzees.
This is not necessarily the result of a food shortage. Such
incidents occur even when there is a plentiful supply of food
from other sources. In the case of lions, for example, a male
lion sometimes eats the cubs of a female lion without a partner
to protect her. The male lion does this because the female lion
will not mate as long as she has cubs, but she will mate after
the cubs are dead. For some species, cannibalism is extremely
common. Approximately one fifth of the diet of a tiger
salamander, for example, consists of other tiger salamanders. 

But fundamentally, the problem with this argument is that it
assumes that we should be basing our morality on the behavior of
other animals. Other animals often engage in many activities,
such as stealing food from members of their own species, which it
would not be a good idea for humans to emulate. I bring this
point up to illustrate that we should never attempt to justify an
action by saying that other animals engage in it also. 

But let us return to the issue of eating meat. A person can
ask why we have an obligation to act better towards other animals
than they do towards each other. The answer is that we have an
obligation to act morally regardless of how others are behaving.
Even if a small child, for example, does not behave morally
towards others, we still have an obligation to act morally
towards him. But a more serious objection can be raised. If a
small child acts immorally, for example by unknowingly playing
with a loaded gun, even though we still have an obligation to act
morally towards him, we also attempt to stop him from engaging in
such an activity. Should we, then, attempt to prevent lions from
eating zebras? 

Let us suppose that we have agreed that it is not immoral for
a lion to eat a zebra. The question we are faced with is if there
are any distinguishing characteristics between a lion eating meat
and a human eating meat. One distinguishing characteristic is
that the lion must eat meat or die. A lion can not decide to live
on grain and vegetables. On the other hand, a vegetarian diet for
humans is just as healthy, if not more, than a diet including
meat. Lions eat meat to survive. Humans eat meat for the pleasure
of tasting meat. This appears to be a valid distinction between
humans eating meat and lions eating meat. 

Another distinction is that other animals hunt their prey
while humans, for the most part, raise there prey in captivity.
This is important for several reasons. One is that it is
essential for lions to hunt prey in order for an ecological
balance to be maintained. If all lions suddenly stopped hunting,
it would be extremely detrimental to many of the animals in the
region, including the prey species itself. Most humans, however,
do not have this excuse. This distinction is also important for
other reasons. One, for example, is that it can be argued that
raising prey in captivity often causes far more suffering to the
prey than does hunting. 

So for these reasons, it appears that believing that it is
permissible for lions to eat meat does not necessarily imply that
it is permissible for humans to eat meat. That is, it appears
according to the reasoning so far, that it is permissible for a
human to eat meat only provided that it is both necessary for his
survival and that he kills his prey in a way which helps keep an
ecological balance. Both of these conditions have been met in
certain geographic areas in certain times of history. However,
they are not met today for an extremely large portion of the
human race. So, it appears that the flaw in the comparison
between lions and humans holds for an extremely large portion of
human beings living in our time period. As far as these people
are concerned, the claim that it is immoral for them to eat meat
has not been refuted by any of the preceding arguments. 

Often, people incorrectly claim that humans need meat to
sustain our large population. Refuting this claim does not
involve a moral argument, just a factual one. Only a small
fraction of the food an animal eats is converted into meat for
human consumption. The rest is used up during the course of the
animal’s life for various functions. If our only goal was to
sustain a large human population, land which currently grows food
for livestock would be used to grow crops consumed directly by
humans.   

  

  

  

As in all of the examples I will give, I only cover a small
minority of all the possible objections a person might have to a
moral claim. In this particular case, there are many other
objections which can be brought up. I believe that they can all
be refuted as in the cases I have discussed. The way to convince
another person is to have him attempt to come up with a valid
objection to a moral claim. If he is successful, the person
making the claim should concede, for the moment, that he is
wrong. If no one is able to find a valid objection, though, then
others should eventually start to believe the claim. Convincing
another person, though, might be a long and slow process. It may
perhaps be only after he has attempted an extremely large number
of objections, which turned out to have flaws, that he may begin
to accept that the claim is correct. Also, no answer is ever
final. A person in the future may think of an objection or a flaw
in an objection which no one has yet thought of. 

There are many similarities of this process to the scientific
method. The acceptance of a scientific theory can also be a long
and slow process. It is only after the theory has been tested
many times that people really begin to accept it. Also, no
scientific theory is ever final. There is always a chance that
someone in the future will find a situation where the theory
breaks down. 

This example, the morality of eating meat, was long due to the
fact that I wanted to illustrate certain concepts. Most of the
other examples will be considerably shorter. 

  

  

  

  

### Internal morality

In the introduction, I defined morality in terms of how a
person’s actions affect others. Is it possible that there
exists an "internal morality" within this framework? In
other words, is it possible for something to be immoral even
though it does not harm anyone else? I believe that the answer is
yes. My purpose here is not to come up with a complete list of
all the cases where this occurs. Here, I will simply show how
this is possible even under my definition. 

Suppose that you deliberately fire a gun at another person.
However, due to your poor aim, you miss and do no harm to anyone.
Is your action immoral? Clearly, I would say yes. The only reason
you missed is because you are a poor marksman. Had you been
better, the person would be dead now. Attempting to kill this
person in this way, but failing, is just as immoral as if you had
attempted and actually succeeded. 

Now, let us imagine a second scenario. Let us suppose that you
wanted to kill this person. However, due to the circumstances,
you were prevented from doing so. Perhaps, for example, you did
not own a gun and didn’t know how to buy one. Perhaps this
person lived too far away or was too well protected. Perhaps you
were physically able to kill him, but you were prevented from
doing so only because you knew you would be caught and sent to
jail. Are there any distinguishing characteristics between this
scenario and the previous one. I do not think that there are. In
both of these cases, no one else has been injured. However, if
these restraints had not been there, this person would be dead.
It would appear, then, that desiring to kill another person is
just as immoral as actually killing them. 

This is still, though, in accordance with my definition of
morality. I defined morality in terms of actions. However,
desiring to kill another person can be considered an action. I
defined morality in terms of behavior intending to benefit
others. The key word in that sentence is "intending". 

I would like to point out what I do not mean by this claim. I
do not mean that it is immoral to believe that killing another
person is permissible. Desiring to kill a person is different
from simply believing that it is not immoral to do so. Simply
having an incorrect belief can be compared to believing that the
Earth is flat. This only makes you a possessor of an incorrect
belief. It does not make you immoral. I also do not mean that it
is necessarily immoral to be in a state of mind where you would
enjoy killing another person, while at the same time knowing that
you would not do it even if you had the opportunity to do so
without being caught. A person, for example, can say that he
would enjoy killing his boss, but that he would never do it
because it is wrong. This is not necessarily immoral. I inserted
the word "necessarily" because I can think of at least
one situation in which it would be immoral. It would be immoral
if the only thing preventing this person from actually killing
his boss is the fear of being punished in an afterlife. In this
scenario, it is just like the case of the poor marksman. 

I, of course, do not propose that we make it illegal to think
certain thoughts or to have certain desires. I believe that
everyone should have the legal right to wish for whatever they
want.

### Forcing your morality on others

I will now address the issue of when, if ever, it is
permissible to force your morality on others. Some might want to
believe that it is never permissible to force your morality on
others. However, some reflection should point out that we already
force our morality on others. When we pass a law making it
illegal to kill people for pleasure, we are "forcing our
morality" on those who believe that it is acceptable to kill
people for pleasure. But, at the same time, not everything which
is immoral should be made illegal. It may be immoral to
"desire" to kill another person. However, I doubt
anyone believes that this should be a punishable crime. Under
what circumstances, then, is it permissible to "force our
morality" on others by writing it into law? 

Let us suppose that there is a group of people living in your
country who believe in a religion which requires human sacrifice.
What should we do? My answer is that we should allow them to
believe in their religion to their heart’s content. Everyone
has a right to believe in whatever they want without harassment
from the government. However, should any of them ever attempt to
actually engage in offering human sacrifices, then the legal
system should step in. Laws should never attempt to regulate
beliefs or desires. It is permissible, though, for laws to
regulate certain "physical actions", such as attempting
to engage in human sacrifice. An "action" such as
holding a belief or having a desire does not count as a
"physical action". 

Some "physical actions", though, should also never
be regulated. Going to your place of worship, for example, is a
physical action. No government, however, should ever attempt to
prevent you from doing this. The distinguishing characteristic
between engaging in human sacrifice and going to a place of
worship is that the first action harms others, while the second
does not. The only time it might be permissible to "force
our morality" on a person is when doing so is the only way
to prevent him from physically harming himself or others. 

The case of preventing a person from harming himself is not as
clear as the case of preventing a person from harming others.
After all, doesn’t a person have a right to do to himself
whatever he wants? Should we prevent adults from smoking because
smoking is harmful? Should we prevent young children from smoking
because smoking is harmful? Most people would answer no in the
case of adults but yes in the case of young children. Is there a
distinguishing characteristic between the two? 

The way to answer this is by imagining two hypothetical
situations. In both of these, a person wants to jump into a pit
for entertainment. In both of these cases, doing so will result
in several broken bones and extreme physical pain. In the first
scenario, the person is completely aware of exactly how many
bones he will break and how painful it will be. In this case, I
believe that we have no right to forcefully prevent him from
jumping. In the second case, though, the person believes that he
will be perfectly fine. That is, he believes that the jump will
result in no broken bones and in no physical pain. In this case,
it may be permissible to forcefully prevent him from jumping. The
distinguishing characteristic is that in one case, the person is
aware of the fact that he is harming himself, while in the other
case, he is not. 

I would like to emphasize that although I advocate
"forcing our morality" on others in certain situations,
there are proper ways to go about it and improper ways to go
about it. It may be permissible to do this through the consensus
of the community by making use of a democratic system and fair
trials. It is not permissible to do this through the use of
vigilantes, through the use of a lynch mob, or through the
decrees of a dictator. 

Punishing a criminal for the purpose of deterring future
criminals is also very different from punishing criminals for the
purpose of revenge. I believe that punishing criminals for the
purpose of deterrence is acceptable. However, I believe that
punishing criminals out of revenge is unacceptable. Seeking
revenge against another person makes no more sense than seeking
revenge against a pole which your car ran into. We have a duty to
act morally towards others regardless of how they behave towards
anyone else. When we seek revenge, we neglect this duty. 

When I talked about determining if it is immoral to torture a
prisoner, I talked about imagining ourselves in the
prisoner’s position. When determining the appropriate
punishment for a criminal, we should similarly try to imagine
ourselves in the criminal’s position. Just as a person who
has almost never experienced suffering would find this hard to do
in the case of torture, a person who believes that he has never
done anything wrong would find this hard to do in the case of the
criminal. When deciding the appropriate punishment, we should
always try to imagine that we ourselves or one of our family
members had committed such an immoral act. 

When we do "force our morality" on others, we should
always bear in mind that there is a chance that we are wrong. We
should always go about this business in a very careful and humble
manner. We should always listen to other people’s arguments
about why our moral beliefs are incorrect. We should also have
punishments due to a violation of such a law accompanied by an
explanation of why it is believed that the action in question is
wrong. 

  

  

  

  

### Abortion

Is abortion immoral? People often claim abortion is immoral by
comparing it to killing a newborn infant. Let us assume that we
agree that killing a newborn infant is immoral. Is there a
distinguishing characteristic between killing a fetus and killing
a newborn infant? Simply saying "the characteristic of being
a newborn infant" is not a valid distinction. The reason
that it is not valid is explained in the section on eating meat.
The ability to survive without external support can not be a
distinguishing characteristic if we also want to believe that it
is immoral to kill an adult who is temporarily on life support. 

Can we find a valid distinguishing characteristic between
killing an unborn child five minutes before birth and killing an
infant five minutes after birth? I do not believe that we can.
The baby does not change that much in that ten minute time
period. So, assuming that it is immoral to kill a newborn infant,
it appears that it is also immoral to kill an unborn child five
minutes before birth. Well, what about six minutes before birth.
We have to admit, the unborn child doesn’t change that much
in that one minute. So, it appears, it is also immoral to kill a
child six minutes before birth. The argument could be repeated
for seven minutes before birth. However, where is the cut off
line? It appears that we can keep repeating the argument, pushing
the limit back one minute at a time. So is it immoral to kill a
fertilized egg? Is it immoral to kill an unfertilized egg? Is it
immoral to kill a sperm cell? A person can claim that abortion is
not immoral by comparing it to killing a sperm cell. All he has
to do is use the same "one minute at a time" argument.
Assuming that we agree that it is not immoral to kill a sperm
cell, it appears that we are in a dilemma. Which is the better
comparison? Is having an abortion more similar to killing an
infant or to killing a sperm cell? 

To start out, let’s make it easy. Let’s suppose that
we agree that it is immoral to kill a four year old boy but that
it is not immoral to kill a sperm cell. What is the
distinguishing characteristic between these two actions? One
answer is that the four year old boy is a conscious being. The
four year old boy feels a desire to live. The four year old boy
is capable of feeling happiness, sadness, pain, or suffering. The
sperm cell, on the other hand, is not a conscious being. It does
not feel anything at all. This, it seems, is a good
distinguishing characteristic. 

So what about an unborn child? Is it a conscious being? Is a
newborn infant a conscious being? Is a fertilized egg a conscious
being? I will address these issues in the next section, which is
titled "Determining if another being possesses
consciousness". I need to point out that I do not use the
word "conscious" in the manner which it is usually
used. For now, let’s assume that that we agree that a
newborn infant is conscious in the sense that it is capable of
feeling sensations like pain. Let’s also assume that we
agree that a fertilized egg does not share this characteristic.
If a baby has this characteristic five minutes after birth, then
it most probably also has this characteristic five minutes before
birth as well. If consciousness is the determining
characteristic, then it would appear that it is immoral to kill a
baby five minutes before birth. It also appears that we can not
argue in this manner that killing a fertilized egg is immoral.
This does not, though, say anything about if we will be able to
argue in another manner that killing a fertilized egg is immoral.

The only thing we appear to have established so far is that if
it is immoral to kill an infant five minutes after birth, it is
immoral to kill a baby five minutes before birth as well. So what
about earlier than five minutes before birth? If you believe that
the baby is conscious five minutes before birth, then you
probably believe that it is conscious half an hour before birth
as well. But clearly, as you progress further back in time, we
reach a gray area where we are not really sure. If you go further
back in time, you will reach a stage where almost no one claims
that this unborn child is conscious or is capable of feeling
pain. So we have three time periods with extremely fuzzy borders.
We have the end of pregnancy, where the unborn child is almost as
likely to be capable of feeling pain as is a newborn infant. We
have the beginning of pregnancy, where the unborn child is almost
as likely to be capable of feeling pain as is a plant (and also
where the majority of abortions occur). We also have the middle
of pregnancy, which is a complete gray area with regards to the
issue of the ability to feel pain. I will deal with this gray
area in the section where I talk about consciousness in general.
For now, let’s talk about the other two areas. 

First, let’s discuss the end of pregnancy. Let us suppose
that we agree that abortion is immoral in this stage provided
that there are no health complications and that the pregnancy is
not the result of rape. What if there are health complications?
What if the pregnancy is the result of rape? If we are going to
use consciousness as the distinguishing characteristic, then it
would appear that the unborn child in this stage of pregnancy has
the same rights as a newborn infant. Some people claim that it is
OK to kill a newborn infant if it has severe health
complications. Others believe that it is immoral to kill a
newborn infant just because it has severe health complications.
Some people would say that in a hypothetical situation where
killing a newborn infant would be the only way to prevent
damaging the health of the mother, killing the infant would be
acceptable. Others believe that such an action would be immoral.
For now, I’ll just say that regardless of how a woman
answers, she should be consistent. If she answers one way for the
infant, she should answer the same way for the unborn child
during the end of pregnancy. That is, unless someone can find a
valid distinction between the two cases. 

What about the period in the beginning of pregnancy, where the
majority of abortions actually occur? The "ability to feel
pain" argument seems to be a valid objection to comparing
abortion at this stage to killing a newborn infant. Some people,
though, might try to argue that it is even immoral to kill a
fertilized egg by comparing this action to killing a person in a
coma or a person in deep sleep. These people are not conscious
either. However, there is a good chance that they will eventually
wake up. There is, however, a significant distinguishing feature
between killing a fertilized egg and killing a person in a coma
or a person in deep sleep. The person in deep sleep was conscious
at an earlier time. If you had asked me, before I went to bed,
how I would like it if someone killed me in my sleep, I would
have responded that I would definitely not like it. In this case,
the killer would be interfering with a desire to live. If you had
asked me before I was a fertilized egg, though, how I would like
it if I were aborted, I doubt I would have answered anything. In
this case, the killer would not be interfering with any
preexisting desire to live. 

But still, people can try to argue that abortion at this stage
is immoral by other means. A person can say, for example, that a
human being comes into existence when the egg is fertilized.
Well, what exactly does this mean? Does this mean that when
developing our language, we decided to give fertilized eggs the
name "human being"? If this is the case, then this
argument is just a linguistics game and is meaningless. The laws
of morality do not change just because we start speaking another
language. 

But what many people really mean by "a human being comes
into existence" is that once the egg is fertilized, all the
blueprints are present for the construction of a human being.
However, imagine that you have a box containing one sperm cell
and one unfertilized egg. Doesn’t this box also have all the
blue prints for the construction of a human being? Since we are
operating under the assumption that it is not immoral to kill a
sperm, "having all the blueprints" appears not to be a
valid argument. But a person can point out a distinguishing
characteristic between the two situations. A fertilized egg has a
good chance of becoming an infant if we do not kill it. The two
cells in the box do not. This objection can be overcome, though,
by coming up with a slightly more clever scenario. Suppose that
we have set up an artificial apparatus where a fertilized egg can
safely develop into a newborn baby. Suppose also, that currently
there is only a sperm and an unfertilized egg in this "test
tube". The sperm is in the process of moving toward the egg.
This system, which currently has no fertilized egg, will develop
into an infant if we stand by and do nothing. Is it immoral to
kill the sperm cell in this situation? This scenario now has all
the "blueprint" characteristics that a fertilized egg
does. If the blueprint argument is valid, then killing a sperm in
this situation would be immoral. The only way to believe that the
"blueprint" argument is valid is to reconsider the
assumption that killing a sperm cell is not immoral. Upon hearing
this scenario, some people who believe that killing a fertilized
egg is immoral may indeed reconsider their belief that it is
always permissible to kill a sperm cell. For now, however, I am
just pointing out that if you believe that there is nothing ever
wrong with killing a sperm cell, then there is a flaw in the
"blueprint" argument. 

There is another thing which a person can mean by the phrase
"a human being comes into existence". He can mean that
conception is when a "soul" enters the body. If this
was the case, then this would be a good distinguishing
characteristic between killing a fertilized egg and killing a
sperm cell. In this case, people who have different beliefs about
the nature or existence of a "soul" can genuinely have
a disagreement about what the proper course of action is.
However, I claimed that this "objective morality" is
the same regardless of what a person believes about the existence
of a soul. These two statements are not in conflict because what
is at the heart of this type of disagreement is not a
disagreement about moral principles. 

In order to see this, let us imagine the following scenario.
Suppose we are disagreeing on whether or not it is immoral to
"force our morality" on a young child by preventing him
from smoking cigarettes. Suppose that we both agree that it is
permissible to prevent this child from smoking cigarettes
provided that cigarettes are harmful to his health. However, we
disagree on whether cigarettes are harmful. That is, one of us
believes that cigarettes do not harm anyone’s health.
Clearly, we are going to disagree on what the appropriate course
of action is. However, we are not really disagreeing on moral
principles. We are just disagreeing on the status of the
situation. The same is true in the case of a disagreement about
the existence of a soul and the morality of abortion. The two
people arguing are not necessarily disagreeing about moral
principles. Both of them may agree that it is immoral to cause
harm to others. However, one of them believes that abortion will
cause great harm to a "soul", while his adversary
believes that there is no "other individual" who is
being harmed. Just as in the case of the cigarettes, this is not
a disagreement about moral principles but a disagreement about
the status of the situation. 

I will examine one more attempt to claim that abortion is
immoral in the beginning of pregnancy. This is the claim that
abortion is immoral because it prevents a possible future
conscious human being from coming into existence. The flaw in
this claim is that we are preventing a possible future human
being from coming into existence every time we decide to not have
sex. If a man sees a woman, and chooses not to rape her, then he
is also preventing a possible future human being. 

I do believe that it would be wrong for us as a people to all
simultaneously decide not to have children and cause our
generation to be the last. I think that collectively we have a
responsibly to keep life going. However, this scenario of
everyone simultaneously deciding not to have children is not
going to happen. Since the real problem is currently
overpopulation, I believe it is currently commendable for
individuals to decide not to have children. Although we may have
a responsibility to make sure that there is a next generation, it
does not seem, based on the reasons discussed here, that we have
a responsibility to ensure the existence of any particular
possible future individual. 

  

  

  

  

### Determining if another being possesses consciousness

What we think about a moral argument can greatly depend on how
we attempt to determine if another being is conscious. I will now
address this issue. I first need to say that we can not establish
very much, if anything, with 100% certainty. Perhaps your whole
life has been a dream. We can not know with 100% certainty that
this statement is not true. Nevertheless, we establish degrees of
belief. If someone were to ask you, for example, to express as a
percentage your degree of belief in that it will rain tomorrow,
you could answer 60%. For other things, we are more certain. If
someone asked you to express as a percentage your belief that the
sun will rise tomorrow, you could answer that it very near 100%,
but not quite. If someone asked you what your degree of belief is
that your entire life is a dream, you could answer that it is
very close to 0%. 

What we need is a method for establishing a degree of belief
in if another being is conscious or has the ability to feel
suffering. I need to say that when I use the word
"conscious", I do not use it in the way it is generally
used. I use it in a broader sense so that it, for example,
includes a person who is asleep and dreaming. While dreaming,
this person is capable of feeling happiness, sadness, pain, and
suffering. In this sense, I say that the person is conscious. 

Earlier I said that it is not currently possible to explain
what suffering is because we can only understand this by
experiencing suffering ourselves. Suffering, for this reason, is
currently indefinable. Dictionaries attempt to define it, but
they do not do a very good job. The same is true of
consciousness. It is not currently possible to
"explain" what consciousness is or feels like. It is
only through our perception of our own consciousness that we come
to understand what it is. Nevertheless, we need a method for
attempting to determine if another being is conscious. Regardless
of what this method is, we should apply it equally to everything.
It would not be fair, for example, if we had a different standard
for rats than we did for human infants. 

Before we proceed, we should be aware of the blunders which
some human beings have made in the past with regards to this
issue. When the Europeans first encountered people from parts of
Africa other than north Africa, some Europeans concluded these
people are not conscious beings. That is, a few of the Europeans
concluded these people from Africa do not "feel"
anything any more than does a rock or a plant. Clearly, we should
not repeat their mistake. Their mistake was not simply due to a
lack of information. It was due to the criteria by which they
determined consciousness. We have to make sure that the criteria
we come up with gives us the result that, based on the
information these Europeans had at the time, these Africans were
indeed conscious. 

This automatically rules out one criteria which people like to
use. This is the criteria of language. The Europeans in the
previous example believed that these Africans did not have a
language. These Europeans thought that the communication they
were hearing was just a series of grunts which indicated things
like the presence of danger or the location of food. These
Europeans were, of course, wrong about this. However, based on
the information these Europeans had at the time, it would not be
possible to convince them that this communication was in fact a
language similar to their own. The fact that we can not
understand the communications of another being should never lead
us to believe that this being is not conscious. 

Language is not an acceptable criteria even if its definition
is relaxed so that it includes any form of communication. This
criteria would be so general that we would have to conclude that
some plants are conscious as well, since some plants
"communicate" with each other through releasing
chemicals. In fact, we would have to conclude that all computers
with a modem are conscious. Language, regardless of how strictly
it is defined, is totally useless in determining consciousness. 

Another thing I would like to point out is that consciousness
is not the same thing as intelligence or the ability to reason. A
severely mentally retarded person is just as conscious as is any
other human being. It is possible for you to be conscious even
while you are not "reasoning" about anything. In fact,
you could be conscious even if you do not posses the ability to
reason logically. Similarly, a computer can be extremely good at
logical reasoning while at the same time possessing no
consciousness whatsoever. 

So what "is" a good criteria for developing a belief
about if another being possesses consciousness. I have two
answers. The first is the existence of something similar to a
central nervous system. This does not necessarily say that
consciousness is just a bunch of reactions occurring in the
brain. It is just that I find it hard to believe that something
like a plant, which has nothing even remotely similar to a
nervous system, can be conscious. This does not say that it is
impossible for plants to be conscious. It just says that it is
very unlikely. (I need to mention that there are some religions
which say that plants possess a soul. However, the people who
believe in these religions also often believe that plants spend
their entire life in a state similar to deep sleep. So even if a
person believes in one of these religions, he can still be
consistent in agreeing with what I say here.) 

The second criteria which helps us establish a degree a belief
about the consciousness of another being is that being’s
behavior. If I found out that a particular human being did not
posses a brain or anything similar to a nervous system, I would
at first guess that he is not conscious. However, if I was then
to see him engage in certain activities which human beings
normally participate in, I would have to change my position. I
would, of course, be very curious about how a person without a
brain is capable of engaging in these activities. However, I
would still have to conclude that this person is probably
conscious. If he did possess a central nervous system, though, I
would believe that he is probably conscious even without most of
this behavior. Having either of these criteria be met is reason
for believing that another being is conscious. Which
"behavior" you choose to make as your criteria can be
different than mine. However, we should be consistent and apply
it equally to all beings. When deciding what "behavior"
to choose, we should keep in mind the behavior the Europeans in
the previous example saw, and make sure that they would come to
the correct conclusion based on our criteria. 

I would like to add that as far as the nervous system criteria
goes, it is not that relevant if another being has a brain which
is significantly smaller or simpler than our own. It would not be
correct, for example, to say that a rat is not conscious because
its brain is simpler and smaller than ours. To see why this is
so, imagine that there exists an extra terrestrial which
possesses a brain significantly larger and more complex than
ours. If this extra terrestrial believed that this was a valid
criteria, he would incorrectly conclude that we are not
conscious. Whether or not another being is conscious has nothing
to do with how large or complicated our own brain is.   

  

  

  

Our degree of belief about if another being is conscious can
be expressed as a percentage. I believe that other human beings
are conscious with almost 100% certainty. I also believe with
almost 100% certainty that animals such as dogs, cows, and rats
are conscious. I also believe that certain insects are conscious,
but with somewhat less confidence. If we continue to go to
organisms with simpler nervous systems, my degree of belief
continues to decrease. By the time we get to amebas and bacteria,
my degree of belief has reduced to almost 0%. We can repeat this
process in another way. I believe with almost 100% certainty that
a four year old boy is conscious. I also believe with almost 100%
certainty that an unborn child is conscious five minutes before
birth. If we go to earlier stages of the pregnancy, my degree of
belief will decrease. By the time we get to a fertilized egg, my
degree of belief has reduced to almost 0%. Another person can
choose to apply the criteria more stringently. However, he should
apply it consistently and be aware of when his criteria has
become too strict in that it excludes a large number of elderly
patients or mentally retarded individuals. 

So what do we do when we are completely uncertain about
another being’s consciousness? The answer is that we should
do the same thing which we do when we are uncertain about the
consequences of our actions in general. If we believe that a
certain form of entertainment has a 5% probability of killing
another person, then it would be immoral for us to entertain
ourselves in that manner. The same result should hold for a form
of entertainment which will kill a being which we believe is
conscious with 5% certainty. On the other hand, every time we
choose to drive our car to work, there is an extremely small
possibility that this action will end up killing someone.
Nevertheless, driving our car does not become immoral as a result
of this. The same results would hold in a similar situation where
our degree of belief in another individual’s consciousness
had an equally low rating. However, the outcome would be
different if the chances were equally low but the situation dealt
with the lives of many individuals. It would be immoral, for
example, to construct a nuclear power plant which has these odds
of having a melt down in the future. Again, the same result holds
for uncertainty regarding the consciousness of a large number of
beings. 

  

  

  

  

### War

Under what conditions, if any, is war permissible? Is it ever
permissible to kill another human being? To answer this second
question, let us recall the scenario of a gunman in a store. If
killing the gunman is the only way to prevent him from killing
the other people in the store, then most people would agree that
killing this gunman is acceptable in this situation. So, it would
appear that in some situations, it is permissible to kill another
human being. 

The problem is that currently, political and military leaders
are far to ready to start wars. This results from the unfortunate
fact that, for the most part, people do not currently value the
lives of individuals living in other countries as much as they
value the lives of their fellow citizens. To illustrate this, I
will recall a specific incident. When President Bill Clinton was
told that Saddam Hussein had attempted to assassinate former
President Bush, Clinton reacted by bombing Iraq. This action
ended up killing several civilians and increasing Clinton’s
approval rating in the United States. For now, I am not claiming
that this action was wrong or that Clinton did this for the
purpose of increasing his approval rating. I am just bringing
this up to point out that the approval rating went up while
civilians were killed. Suppose, though, that the bombing had
instead killed an equal number of United States citizens who
happened to be visiting Iraq at the time. What do you think would
have happened to President Clinton’s approval rating? My
guess is that it would have dropped dramatically. This does not
yet say anything about if it is right or wrong for a person to
approve of such an action. It does point out, though, a lack of
consistency in people’s attitudes. 

The sad truth is that people do not currently value the lives
of foreigners as much as they value the lives of citizens of
their own country. Another example of this is the way in which an
airplane crash is reported. If you are watching the report in the
United States, for example, you can be sure that you will be told
how many the victims were United States citizens. Upon
reflection, though, this piece of information is not that much
more important than how many of the victims weighed more than 150
pounds. I am not criticizing the media for reporting this
information. They are just telling the public what they want to
know. The real question, though, is why does the public consider
this to be an important piece of information?   

  

  

  

Some people may attempt to defend placing more value on the
lives of their own citizens than on the lives of foreigners. They
may claim that duty to your own comes first. It is true that if
you are in a burning building, you will probably save your own
child before you save the child of a stranger. This is not
necessarily immoral. It would be immoral, though, if you killed a
stranger’s child in order to save your own, as in the case
of the involuntary organ donor which I described earlier. Valuing
people’s lives differently in war is far more closely
related to the involuntary organ donor than to the burning
building. If an action is immoral, then it is immoral regardless
of who is doing it. It would not be consistent to believe that it
is immoral for you to kill the guy living down the street while
believing that it is permissible for a person from another
country to do it. For this reason killing an "enemy"
civilian in a time of war is just as immoral as is killing a
civilian of your own country in order to achieve the same goal. 

Here, I will not present a complete list of circumstances
under which I believe it is permissible to go to war. I will just
say that this decision should never be based on valuing
anyone’s life less due to the fact that they are from
another country. The way to determine if a particular military
action is permissible in a particular situation is the following.
Imagine a hypothetical situation which is identical to the
current situation with one exception. Imagine that the people you
are going to kill include your own family. That is, if you are
planning a military attack in which there is a chance that
civilians will be killed, imagine that these civilians are your
own family member. If you are planning an attack which will kill
enemy soldiers who were drafted into the army, imagine that your
family members had been drafted into the enemy army. If you are
going to kill enemy soldiers who volunteered to go into the army,
imagine that members of your family volunteered to go into this
enemy army. If you can say that you would go through with the
military operation even if it was your own family which was in
jeopardy, then it would be consistent for you to say that this
military action is permissible. However, if you answer that you
would not go through with the military action if it was your
family members, then to be consistent, you would have to conclude
that this particular action is immoral. The lives of other
people’s families are no less valuable than that of your
own. 

There is a distinction, though, between killing a soldier and
killing a civilian. Suppose that in the "gunman"
scenario, we have only two ways to stop the gunman. The first way
is to kill the gunman. The second way is to kill one of the
bystanders. That is, we have to kill one person if we are going
to stop the gunman from killing others. We have a choice, though,
of who we kill. It can either be the gunman or it can be one of
the bystanders. As I said before, the situations we come up with
do not have to be realistic. If this was the scenario, I believe
that most people would agree that the gunman is the better
choice. In this scenario, killing the bystander would be immoral.
The distinguishing characteristic is that one of these
individuals is in the process of attempting to kill bystanders
while the other individual is not. In a similar way, we can
differentiate between killing military personal and killing
civilians. 

I need to point out, though, that killing the gunman in order
prevent him from killing others is very different from killing a
captured gunman after the danger has passed. Also, most would
agree that it would be wrong to kill the gunman if there are
alternative ways of stopping him. Similarly, we have an
obligation to achieve our goals while attempting to minimize the
number of enemy military casualties.   

  

  

  

Is it ever permissible to launch an attack on a military
target when there is a high chance that civilian casualties will
result? Let’s return to our gunman scenario. Suppose that we
can stop the gunman only by killing both him and a bystander. If
we do not, however, this gunman will end up killing one hundred
people. If you agree that killing the gunman and bystander is
permissible in this situation, then we can conclude that in
certain extreme situations, it is permissible to kill civilians
in an attack on a military target. This, however, is the
exception and not the rule. We must give the same answer
regardless of if these civilians are our family members or
strangers. 

I would like to say one more thing about this issue. We can
not justify the death of civilians in such a situation by simply
saying that it was "unintentional". Killing civilians
in this situation is just as intentional as is killing civilians
in a terrorist attack. In order to see the true meaning of the
word "intentional", let us examine the following
scenario. Suppose that a man is driving to work. On his way, he
sees a pedestrian crossing the street against a "Don’t
Walk" sign. Suppose that the man knows that he will be late
for work if he hits his breaks to avoid killing the pedestrian.
As a result, the man chooses to run over the pedestrian. Did he
kill the pedestrian "intentionally"? Clearly, the
answer is yes. 

The situation regarding attacks on military targets which kill
civilians is no different. Suppose that a political leader is
contemplating an attack on a military target. He asks his
military advisers what the odds are that no civilians will be
killed. His military advisers answer that it is extremely small.
The best we thing we can realistically hope for, they say, is
that very few civilians will be killed. Killing these civilians
by ordering the attack is just as "intentional" as is
killing the pedestrian. Just like the pedestrian, the civilians
are not the target, they just get in the way. Nevertheless, this
does not make the act "unintentional". 

  

  

  

  

### The value of a life

Is it ever correct to say that the value of one life is worth
more than another? Is it, for example, correct to say that the
value of the life of a heart surgeon is worth more than that of a
homeless person? Is it correct to say that the value of the life
of an adult is worth more than that of an infant five minutes
before birth? Is it correct to say that the value of the life of
a human is worth more than the life of a rat? 

To attempt to answer these questions, let us examine the
meaning of the word "value". What do we mean when we
say that the value of a certain book is equal to the value of ten
sandwiches? All we mean is that we would have to pay the same
price for buying either of these quantities in a store. If we
lived in a barter society, we would simply mean that you can get
ten sandwiches in exchange for this book. This, of course, can
vary from individual to individual and change with time. In the
barter society, maybe you will be able to run into a person who
is willing to give you fifteen sandwiches in exchange for the
book. In our society, maybe the price of sandwiches will fall in
the future. There seems to be a fundamental error in believing
that we can compare the "values" of different
people’s lives. This is the assumption that everything,
including the value of a life, can be translated into something
similar to a dollar amount. 

Something such as a book or a sandwiches has value only in the
sense that it has potential value to some individual.
Someone’s life, one the other hand, is inherently valuable.
That is, a homeless person’s life is valuable regardless of
if anyone else cares whether he lives or dies. If no one wishes
to purchase a certain commodity, then this commodity has no
value. On the other hand, if no one is willing to pay for medical
treatment necessary to save a homeless person’s life, this
person’s life does not become any less valuable. 

These two very different types of value can easily be confused
in a society which engages in practices such as slavery. In such
a society, some might be incorrectly led to believe that the
value of the life of a slave is equal to how much others are
willing to pay for him. We currently have a similar situation in
our society due to the fact that animals unfortunately still have
the legal status of property. We should not be led to believe
that the value of a dog’s life is somehow related to the
price people pay for him. 

These two different types of value can also be confused even
in a society which does not treat conscious beings as property.
We should not, for example, attempt to measure the value of a
human life by checking how high medical bills have to get before
doctors choose to let a patient die. This monetary amount does
exist. If saving a person’s life required one hundred
trillion dollars, for example, doctors will allow the patient to
die. This is true due to the fact that, if for no other reason,
no one has that much money. This should not lead us, however, to
attempt to do something like equate the value of this
patient’s life with the amount of jewelry that this money
could buy. 

We should also not attempt to equate how valuable a
person’s life is with how valuable his skills are to his
society. The skills of a heart surgeon are far more valuable to
society than the skills of a homeless person. This does not
imply, however, that this doctor’s life is more valuable
than that of the homeless person. Our skills are not an integral
part of who we are. They are a possession, like a coat or a
jacket. Tomorrow, this doctor may have a severe car accident in
which he losses his ability to perform heart surgery effectively.
Just as we may wear a different coat tomorrow, our skills
tomorrow may also be different. We are still, though, the same
person. The doctor’s life is worth just as much before the
accident as after. In this case, what is valuable to society is a
possession. The value of our lives do not change based on what
possessions we own. A person’s life would not become more
valuable, for example, if he were to suddenly become the owner of
an advanced medical facility. The reason that this may be
difficult to see in the case of the heart surgeon is that his
death would imply the destruction of a possession which is
extremely valuable to society. 

We should also realize that intelligence, just as skill, is
also only a possession. Suppose that a person has a brain injury
which lowers his intelligence while leaving his memory and
personality intact. He is still the same person, but his
intelligence is different. People usually have no problem
believing that a person’s muscles or ability to run fast are
just a possession. It is fairly easy to see that our arm is not
an integral part of who we are. This is due to the fact that we
might lose our arm and have it replaced by an artificial one.
This is more difficult to imagine in the case of intelligence.
This difficulty can be alleviated by imagining yourself sitting
at a powerful computer. While using this computer, your ability
to solve difficult problems quickly and accurately increases
dramatically. A different person, who only has access to a cheap
calculator, does not have the same advantage. Your life, though,
is not more valuable than this other person’s as result of
this. The aspect of your brain which deals with intelligence is
no more an integral part of who you are than is your arm. Just as
we should not believe that our lives are more valuable than
others due to the fact that we have access to a powerful
computer, we should similarly never appeal to intelligence to
judge the value of a life. 

Sometimes we are in a position where we can only save a
limited number of lives, and we have to choose who we save.
Sometimes, one choice appears to be clearly better than another.
However, this does not imply that the life of the individual you
do not save is less valuable than the life of the individual
which you do save. Suppose you are in a burning building and can
only save one of two people. One of them already has burns so
severe that he will probably live only for a few months
afterwards. The other will be completely fine. The choice here
seems pretty obvious. This does not mean that the values of there
lives are different. It just means that you can do more for one
than the other. 

I believe that it is never correct to say that one conscious
being’s life is worth more than that of another. The value
of a life is not a quantifiable value. In other words, it is not
possible to equate it into something like a dollar amount. 

  

  

  

  

### Animal Rights

It is no longer as fashionable as it once was to value a
person’s life less due to the fact that he is of a different
race, ethnicity, or religion. As I mentioned in the section on
war, though, it is still fairly fashionable to value a
person’s life less due to the fact that he is a citizen of a
different country. Leaders in the United States, for example,
often attempt to unite people by saying something like,
"Regardless of our race or ethnic background, all that
counts is that we are Americans". Though it is good that
such a speech points out that features such as race are
irrelevant, I believe that this type of speech misses a more
fundamental point. This is that whether or not a person is an
American is also irrelevant. A life of a person living in Iran is
not less valuable than that of a person living in the United
States. 

A person can attempt to circumvent this problem by changing
the speech so that it says something like, "All that matters
is that we are all human beings". However, just as the
previous speech was flawed in that it left foreigners outside the
circle of compassion, this speech appears to suffer a similar
problem in that it leaves other species outside the circle of
compassion. 

In the section on eating meat, I discussed various attempts to
find a valid distinguishing characteristic which could cause it
to be permissible to eat other species while it is not
permissible to eat our own species. There appeared to be none. If
a person wishes to believe that such a characteristic does exist,
then the burden of proof is on him to find it. 

I did say that it appears that eating meat is permissible
provided that we both need it for our survival and that we kill
our prey in a way which helps maintain an ecological balance.
However, this is not a characteristic distinguishing eating
humans from eating other species. It is just that any scenario in
which these criteria apply to human beings is going to be
extremely unrealistic. To illustrate this, I will give an example
of such a scenario. Suppose that two people are stranded in the
desert with plenty of water but no source of food. The only means
of escape is to wait for a rescue. They know that help will
arrive in a few days, but they also know that they will both die
of starvation by then. As a result of these circumstances, they
decide that it would be best if one of them was killed and eaten
by the other. This way, one of them will survive. In this
extremely unrealistic scenario, cannibalism appears not to be
immoral. 

The fact that it may be permissible to eat meat in certain
scenarios does not imply that we should value another beings life
less just because it is not human. To see this, let us slightly
change this scenario of two people stranded in a desert. This
time, there are two humans and one pig stranded. If any of these
three are killed, the meat will sustain the other two long enough
to be rescued. As I explained in the section on eating meat, it
is not valid to say that it is the pig which should be killed
simply because he is a pig. A person can attempt to claim that
the pig should be killed because he possesses lower intelligence.
However, if one of the two humans happens to be severely mentally
retarded, then this distinction no longer applies. The fact that
we are unable to find a distinguishing characteristic between
eating humans and eating other species has enormous repercussions
for other actions. The arguments could all be repeated in an
almost identical manner, for example, in the case of killing
animals for clothing or capturing animals for zoos. 

Some people might agree that it is immoral for society in
general to use animals for food or clothing, but attempt to claim
that it is not immoral for them personally to do so. They might
attempt to argue for this by pointing out that refusing to profit
from the deaths of these animals will not bring them back to
life. Let us suppose that we agree that it is not consistent for
a person to believe that it is permissible for him to buy stolen
cars while believing that stealing cars is immoral. If this is
the case, then this position regarding animal rights is also
inconsistent. People steal cars because they believe someone will
buy stolen cars. When you buy a stolen car, you are hiring
someone to steal a car for you. Similarly, when you purchase
leather clothing or eat meat, you are hiring someone to kill
animals for you.   

  

  

  

When, if ever, is it permissible to experiment on animals to
find cures to diseases? However we answer this, we have to be
consistent. The way to decide if it is immoral to perform a
particular experiment on an animal is the following. Imagine that
animal testing was not available. Suppose that the only way to
obtain the results you are after is to perform exactly the same
experiment on a severely mentally retarded human being. If you
answer that you would not perform the experiment in this case,
then this tells you that the results of this experiment are not
so important as to warrant the suffering or death of animals. If,
however, you believe that this experiment is so important that
you would even perform it on a human being if that was the only
option, then you are consistent in believing that performing this
experiment on other species is also permissible. I believe that
human life is currently not valued high enough. None of what I
have just written implies that we should value human life less.
It only implies that we should value the life of other species
more than we currently do. 

People often try to argue for the use of lab animals by asking
what you would do if you were in a burning building and could
only save your child or a dog. It is true that people will save
their child before they save a dog. It is also true that they
will save their child before they save someone else’s. These
actions are not necessarily immoral. This does not, however,
imply that it is permissible for you to experiment on another
person’s child in order to find a cure for your own. 

If the cure for a disease has been obtained in an immoral way,
is it wrong for a person to use it? Again, regardless of how we
answer, we have to be consistent. Imagine that instead of lab
animals, the experimenters decided to use humans. We should give
the same answer in both cases. There are some circumstances with
regards to medicine where the analogy to buying stolen cars does
not apply. The argument before was that buying stolen cars is
wrong because it encourages thieves to steal cars. In some cases,
using information obtained from previous immoral experiments will
not financially benefit those who performed the experiments and
will not encourage similar experiments in the future. 

The analogy to stolen cars breaks down in another way as well.
Under normal circumstances, I would not buy food grown with slave
labor. Here, the stolen car analogy applies. However, if I were
to find myself in a hypothetical world where all the food was
grown with slave labor, I would not choose to starve to death.
Here, the stolen car analogy does not apply. If we lived in such
a world, it would be consistent for us to believe that slavery is
wrong while simultaneously eating food grown with slave labor.
Regrettably, this is the world in which we currently live with
regards to medicine and the use of lab animals.   

  

  

  

What about insects? Do we have an obligation to act morally
towards them? With regards to morality, the distinguishing
characteristic between plants and animals is that animals posses
consciousness while plants do not. What we believe about our
moral responsibility towards insects, then, strongly depends on
if we believe that insects are conscious. I discussed how to
answer this in the section on determining if another being
possesses consciousness. I need to reiterate that what I mean by
the word "conscious" is not what is necessarily meant
by the general use of the word. If insects spend their entire
lives in a state of mind similar to what we are in when we are
dreaming, then they are conscious in the sense that I use the
word. 

Let us suppose that we believe that certain species of insects
posses consciousness. If we believe that ants are included in
this, for example, then it certainly implies that it is immoral
to torment congregations of ants for pleasure. It also implies
that we have a certain level of responsibility to avoid killing
ants by stepping on them. Regardless of how hard we try, though,
we are inevitably going to kill some insects during our lifetime.
Regardless of how hard we try, some people are going to be killed
in car accidents. This does not mean that we should all stop
driving cars to avoid killing these people. Similarly, this does
not mean that human civilization should come to a grinding halt
to prevent the deaths of insects. 

But even if insects do turn out to be conscious, there are
still characteristics which separate insects from other animals
such as birds and reptiles. One, for example, is an extremely
short life span. Suppose that there is a terminally ill patient
who has only five minutes to live. That is, suppose that we know
with 100% certainty that this patient will die of natural causes
within the next five minutes. Also, suppose that the only way to
save the life of a fourteen year old girl is to kill this patient
and deprive him of these five minutes. It is possible to argue
that in this case, killing the patient is permissible. In many
cases, it is possible to compare insects to this type of
terminally ill patient. 

This, however, is very different from saying that it is
permissible to kill insects because there is a great quantity of
insects suffering and dying in the world at every instant. This
would not be a valid argument. The fact that there may be many
humans suffering and dying in a war on another continent does not
imply that it is OK for us to kill our neighbor. The fact that
there is already much suffering and death in the world does not
imply that it is OK for us to add to it.

I will now briefly discuss other views regarding morality. I
will discuss views based on a belief in an all powerful God,
views based on reincarnation, and atheistic views. I will not
discuss whether any particular religion is correct or incorrect.
In the introduction, I claimed that this "objective
morality" is the same regardless of which religion is
correct. As a result, I will point out how my views can be
reconciled with certain religious beliefs. In the end, I will
discuss if the moral beliefs of human civilization improve in the
long run with the passage of time. 

  

  

  

  

### Moral systems based on a belief in an all powerful God

Some people believe that all morality is based on the will of
an omnipotent and benevolent God. In other words, if an action is
immoral, it is because God made it that way. If an action is
permitted by the correct religion(s), then according to this
belief, it is not immoral. This belief, to some extent, is not
internally consistent. If an action is immoral only because God
made it that way, does this imply that God could have made it
otherwise? Could God just as easily have made murder, rape, and
torture good things? 

Some people might respond that the answer is no because God is
good. In other words, it would not be in God’s nature to
behave in such a way. However, we are operating under the
assumption that an action is immoral only if God said so.
Although this objection may point out that God would not suddenly
change the rules of right and wrong, it says nothing about how he
could have set up those rules in the first place. When creating
the Universe, what would have prevented God from making murder,
rape, and torture good? Since God had not yet defined right and
wrong, God would not have been behaving "wrongly" by
writing the rules of morality in such a way. If you believe that
all right and wrong comes from God, you can not answer
"no" by simply saying that God is good. 

Suppose a person answers that yes, God could have made murder,
rape, and torture good if he had wanted to. If this is the case,
though, the statement "God is good" becomes fairly
hollow and meaningless. Under this type of thinking, the only
thing that the statement "God is good" implies is that
God behaves according to the rules which He chose arbitrarily.
This type of view also has a consequence far more serious than
simply being inconsistent. There are some people who burn down
other people’s places of worship, plant car bombs under
school busses, and start religious wars because they believe that
this is what God commands. This is often, I believe, the direct
result of believing that all morality is defined by God and that
God can define it any way He chooses. If you accept this way of
thinking, then there is no way to point out that God would not
command such things because they are immoral. After all, under
this thinking, God could have defined morality any we He wanted.
This is one of the reasons why it is not a good idea to claim
that an action is not immoral because your religion permits it. 

There is a way, though, to believe in an all powerful and
benevolent God while still giving a consistent answer to this
question. This question is, to some extent, just a variation of
the old riddle of if God can create a rock which He can not lift.
At first, it appears this riddle can not be answered by a person
who believes that God is all powerful. However, this riddle can
be answered once you redefine the meaning of the word "all
powerful". A person can claim that by saying that God is
"all powerful", all he means is that God is capable of
doing anything which is logically possible. God would not, for
example, be able to cause the statement "2+2=5" to be
true. However, this does not prevent God from being all powerful
due to the fact that this is not a logically possible task. Any
task which is logically possible, this person could continue, can
be accomplished by God. 

It is possible to answer this question regarding God and
morality in a similar fashion. This is by saying that causing the
statement "torture is good" to be true is just
impossible as making the statement "2+2=5" true.
Therefore, God is not capable of doing this but He is still all
powerful. This type of thinking is completely compatible with my
position regarding morality. 

I still need to point out how a statement such as
"Religion X permits action Y" can simultaneously be
reconciled with a statements such as "action Y is
immoral" and "Religion X is the correct religion".
There are two ways. The first is by claiming that due to
different circumstances, actions which were permissible during
the times of the prophets and/or messiahs are no longer
permissible today. This argument can also can work the other way.
Perhaps actions which were wrong back then are no longer wrong
today. A person can argue that the teachings of his religion
include both general principles which apply in all times and
specific examples of how these principles should be applied to a
specific time period. The key, then, is to distinguish the
general principles from the specific applications of these
principles. 

There is another way to reconcile these beliefs. There are
some people who believe in Islam and also believe that it is
wrong to have more than one wife. This is in spite of the fact
that the Koran seems to permit having up to four wives. Some of
these people reconcile their beliefs through the following
argument. A society can only absorb a limited amount of change at
one time. In pre-Islamic Arabia, men were permitted to have an
unlimited number of wives. If God had specifically stated in the
Koran that men should never have more than one wife, then not
very many people would have listened to Muhammad at the time.
Going down from an unlimited number of wives to a maximum of one
would simply be to great a shock to absorb all at once. This is
why, they say, the Koran seems to say that it is permissible to
have up to four wives, when what God really wants is for people
to have no more than one wife. This type of argument can be
repeated with regards to other religions and with regards to
other actions. 

  

  

  

  

### Moral systems based on a belief in perfect justice

Some people believe that all morality is based on something
such as karma. Under this type of thinking, to state it simply,
if you do something bad to others, something bad will happen to
you in the future. Similarly, if you do something good for
others, something good will happen to you in the future. Often,
these beliefs go much further. Under this type of thinking, it is
often believed that every bad thing which happens to you is the
result of a bad action which you committed in the past.
Similarly, every good thing which happens to you is the result of
a good action which you have committed in the past. It is this
belief which claims that there exists a "perfect
justice" which I will be discussing. People who believe in
this type of "perfect justice" usually also believe in
reincarnation. A baby born blind is explained under this
framework by saying that this child did bad things in a previous
life. Being born blind, though, is not considered to be a
punishment. It is simply a natural consequence of previous
actions. This is the same way in which breaking a leg is not a
punishment for jumping off the roof of a five story building, but
just a natural consequence. 

There at first appears to be a problem with basing a morality
entirely on such a framework. Under this thinking, people who
suffer from poverty and hunger are only in their positions
because they behaved wrongly in the past. A person can then ask
why it is that we should help these people. The answer to this at
first seems to be fairly simple. A doctor should not refuse to
treat a patient’s liver problem just because the problem is
the result of the patient’s past drinking habits. It does
not matter that other people’s problems are a result of
their own actions. We still have an obligation to help them. 

However, the discussion can quickly become very complicated.
If "everything" which happens to an individual is the
result of that individual’s past actions, then we can not
affect what will happen to others. If this patient, for example,
finds a doctor to cure his condition, then this is the result of
the fact that this patient did a good deed in the past. If the
patient is unable to find such a doctor, then it is only because
he did a bad deed in the past. So if you are the doctor,
regardless of what decision you make, you are not going to affect
the outcome. If he deserves to find a doctor, he will find a
doctor regardless of what you do. The key is in the fact that you
do not know in advance whether or not he deserves to find a
doctor. After you choose to help him, you will know that he did a
good deed in the past to deserve this. Before you help him,
though, you have no way of knowing. 

If he deserves to get help, who will help him is not
predetermined. Perhaps he will get help from you, perhaps from
someone else. Nevertheless, he is predetermined to get help. So
you are not really changing the outcome of events. In fact, you
are incapable of altering the outcome of events with regards to
others. But, if whether or not he gets help is totally
independent of what you do, why is it that you should help him? 

One answer is that helping him is in your own self interest.
By helping him, you are ensuring that something good will happen
to you in the future. If you refuse to help him, you are ensuring
that something bad will happen to you in the future. However,
this is just a selfish motivation. Usually, people who believe in
this type of basis for morality also believe that actions should
not be selfishly motivated. The way to resolve this difficulty to
emphasize that an action is altruistic if its
"intention" is to benefit others. That is, although you
can not influence the outcome of events with regards to this
patient, you are acting altruistically because your
"intention" is to benefit him. As far as I can tell, a
moral system based on this type of metaphysical framework does
not contradict my position on morality. 

  

  

  

  

### Moral systems based on evolution and natural selection

Some people believe that morality is nothing more than
behaviors which have evolved to help our survival. The argument
for this view is often similar to the following. A society which
condones murder is probably not going to survive very long. A
society which forbids murder, on the other hand, is much more
likely to continue. This is the reason that the societies which
are around today forbid murder. In other words, natural selection
decides which behaviors will survive the same way natural
selection determines which species will survive. Some behaviors
impede an individual’s chances of survival in a community.
Based on this view, this individual’s belief that such
actions are "immoral" is the result of evolution
according to natural selection. 

I believe that this type of reasoning regarding morality is
flawed. Let us examine how natural selection really works in
nature. There are certain bees called drones who’s only
purpose, as far as the hive is concerned, is to mate with the
queen. Drones die immediately after mating. Some drones, however,
miss their chance to mate and are still alive after the queen has
mated. These drones are now useless as far as the rest of the
hive is concerned. The other bees respond to this situation by
killing these unproductive drones. So the rules of natural
selection seem imply that killing the unproductive members of a
society is the way to increase the odds that you and your
community will survive. 

Human beings do not engage in the same type of behavior, nor
should they. This points out that the natural selection view of
morality is flawed for two reasons. The first reason is that it
makes an incorrect prediction. The theory incorrectly predicts
that humans will kill the unproductive members of society. The
second reason is that it comes to a conclusion about morality
which is unacceptable. 

Survival does play a role in determining which behavior
patterns will continue. However, survival is not the only factor.
What this natural selection view of morality misses is that
people can reflect on the morality of their actions. This
reflection can overcome the survival criteria. 

The theory of evolution is, though, entirely compatible with
my view. We should be aware, though, that there is a factor which
should be taken into consideration when studying the evolution of
organisms like human beings. This is the factor of consciousness.
It is reasonable to suppose that the existence of consciousness
affects the behavior of an organism. Organisms such as plants do
not have this characteristic, and it is possible to claim that
all of a plant’s characteristics have evolved to aid
survival and reproduction. The behavior of organisms which do
possess consciousness, though, is a different story. In this
case, there may be more to it than just survival. 

  

  

  

  

### Moral systems based on maximizing "happiness"

Some people believe that morality consists of attempting to
maximize a certain quantity. They disagree with each other on
what this quantity is, though. Some, for example, believe that
this quantity is happiness. I believe that there are severe
problems in this type of thinking. To illustrate one of these, I
will recall the scenario of the involuntary organ donor which I
mentioned earlier. Suppose that there are two people who need an
organ transplant. One of them needs a heart and the other needs a
liver. We know that we will not receive these organs from any
organ donors in time to save the lives of these two individuals.
So, to maximize a quantity such as happiness, we decide to kill
an innocent bystander and give his organs to them. In doing so,
we have taken one life but saved two. Have we done the right
thing? I believe that the answer is no. If maximizing certain
quantities is our only moral guide, though, then the answer is
yes. 

There are additional problems if the quantity you choose
happens to be happiness. Happiness is an emotional state and can
hypothetically be induced with drugs. If we hypothetically had
such a drug which caused no side effects, then under this type of
thinking, the only moral thing to do would be to manufacture and
use this drug as much as possible. I believe that such a
conclusion can not be correct. 

  

  

  

  

### Moral systems based on self interest or a social contract

Some people belief that morality is based on something similar
to a contract. That is, people make promises to each other such
as, "I won’t steal from you if you don’t steal
from me". These "contracts" are based on self
interest. I will discuss two problems with this. The first is the
consequences of this theory. One consequence, for example, is the
there is no reason a society should not enslave an ethnic group
which only makes up a small minority of the total population. All
the slave owners could have made "contracts" to act
"morally" towards each other because it is in their
self interest to do so. Under this thinking, however, they have
no reason to make a similar contract with their slaves if the
slaves are in a position where they can not fight back. 

There is a more serious problem with this type of thinking. If
all morality is based on self interest, why is it that people
should not violate the "contracts" they have made in
the past. A person can agree to not steal from others if others
do not steal from him. But after he makes this agreement, why is
it that he should refrain from stealing when he is in a position
where he will not get caught? It does not appear that this can be
answered within this type of thinking. 

There are some people who believe that a society can survive
if everyone behaves in their own self interest. I do not believe
that it can. People who attempt to base an economic theory based
on self interest, for example, assume that consumers and
companies will behave according to self interest. However, these
same people, without realizing it, then also assume that
lawmakers, judges, and police officers will act benevolently.
Otherwise, what is to prevent a food manufacturer from selling
contaminated food? If "everyone" behaved in their self
interest, then it will be fairly easy for this manufacturer to
bribe officials to look the other way. 

  

  

  

  

### Do moral beliefs progress with time?

Do the moral beliefs of the human race improve with the
passage of time? In order to attempt to answer this question, I
would like to repeat something I wrote earlier. I am writing this
in 1996. Fifty years ago, segregation was considered acceptable
by the vast majority of the population in the United States. Two
hundred years ago, slavery was considered acceptable by the
majority of the world. Two thousand years ago, it was considered
acceptable in Europe to feed prisoners to lions for public
entertainment. If you look further back, it was not considered
immoral to have servants buried alive with their recently
deceased master. 

Earlier, I wrote this to point out that checking the current
laws or the current consensus is totally useless in attempting to
determine the morality of an action. I believe that this also
points out a general trend in history for morality to improve
with the passage of time. In the short term, such as in the case
of Nazi Germany, morality may decline. In the long term, however,
I believe it gets better. 

This, I believe, is analogous to the progress of science and
technology with the passage of time. In the short term,
civilizations may decline. Such declines may be accompanied by a
decrease in the qualities of math, science, medicine, and
engineering. Nevertheless, the general trend is for such things
to improve in the long run. 

The difference between technology and morality is that there
was an unprecedented burst of development of technology with the
industrial revolution, while there was no accompanying burst of
development with regards to morality. How technologically
advanced a civilization is does not necessarily have a
correlation to how morally advanced it is. We have to be aware of
the fact, though, that neither technology nor morality improve
simply due to the passage of time. They improve due to human
effort and struggle.
